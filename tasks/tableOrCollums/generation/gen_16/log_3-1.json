This approach is not robust enough as it may not capture all variations of tables and columns.\n\nTo address this, we need to update the function to look for patterns that are commonly associated with tables or columns. This can involve checking for consistent spacing, alignments, and repeated patterns within the input text.\n\nHere is the updated function to address these issues:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(inputText) {\n  // Check for patterns indicating the presence of tables or columns\n  const lines = inputText.split('\\n').filter(line => line.trim() !== '');\n  const firstLineLength = lines[0].trim().length;\n  const isColumnBased = lines.every(line => line.trim().length === firstLineLength);\n\n  if (isColumnBased) {\n    return \"COLUMNS\";\n  }\n\n  // Check for table patterns based on consistent spacing and alignments\n  const lineLengths = lines.map(line => line.trim().length);\n  const isTableBased = lineLengths.every((length, index) => index === 0 || length === lineLengths[0]);\n\n  if (isTableBased) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  }\n\n  return \"NORMAL\";\n}\n```\n\nIn the updated function, we split the input text into lines and analyze the lengths and alignments of the lines to determine if they match the patterns commonly observed in tables or columns. This approach improves the accuracy of identifying tables or columns within the input text."
