      "content": "The issue with the current function is that it's using a simple regular expression pattern to detect a table. This pattern is not capturing the specific structure of a table with headers and rows. To improve the function, we can use a more robust approach to detect the presence of a table.\n\nIn order to properly detect tables or columns, we should analyze the overall structure of the input text to look for patterns that resemble a table or columns. This could include looking for rows with consistent columns or a header followed by rows with similar column structure.\n\nHere's the revised function using a more advanced approach to detect tables or columns in the input text:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(inputText) {\n  // Use regular expressions to search for common table and column patterns\n  const tablePattern = /(\\w+(\\s+\\w+){2,}\\s*\\n){2,}/; // Pattern for detecting a table\n  const columnPattern = /^\\s*\\w+(\\s+\\w+)+\\s*$/mg; // Pattern for detecting columns\n  \n  const containsTable = tablePattern.test(inputText);\n  const containsColumns = columnPattern.test(inputText);\n  \n  if (containsTable && containsColumns) {\n    return \"TABLE_AND_COLUMNS\";\n  } else if (containsTable) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  } else if (containsColumns) {\n    return \"COLUMNS\";\n  } else {\n    return \"NORMAL\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this revised function, we have updated the regular expressions to better capture the structure of a table and columns. The `tablePattern` now looks for multiple rows with at least 3 words in each row, and the `columnPattern` looks for lines with multiple words separated by spaces. This approach should provide more accurate detection of tables and columns in the input text."
