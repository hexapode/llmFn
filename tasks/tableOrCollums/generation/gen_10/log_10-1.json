      "content": "It looks like the function did not correctly identify the presence of a table in the input text. The issue is that the function currently only checks for the presence of the word \"table\" in the text, but it should also account for the structure and layout of the text to accurately determine the presence of a table.\n\nLet's update the function to better handle this. The new approach will be to identify the presence of both rows and columns in the text to determine if it contains a table.\n\nHere is the updated function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(text) {\n  // Split the text into lines\n  const lines = text.split('\\n');\n  // Check if any line contains multiple words separated by spaces\n  const hasColumns = lines.some(line => line.trim().split(/\\s+/).length > 1);\n  // Check if there are multiple lines with the same number of columns\n  const hasRows = lines.filter(line => line.trim().split(/\\s+/).length > 1).length > 1;\n  // If there are both rows and columns, it's likely to be a table\n  if (hasRows && hasColumns) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  }\n  // If there are only columns without multiple rows, it's columns\n  else if (hasColumns) {\n    return \"COLUMNS\";\n  }\n  // If there are multiple rows without columns, it's also a table\n  else if (hasRows) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  }\n  // If none of the above conditions are met, return \"NORMAL\"\n  else {\n    return \"NORMAL\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this update, the function checks for both the presence of columns and rows based on the structure of the text. If there are multiple rows with columns, it will be classified as a \"TABLE\". If there are only columns without multiple rows, it will be classified as \"COLUMNS\". If there are multiple rows without columns, it will also be classified as a \"TABLE\". If none of the above conditions are met, it will be classified as \"NORMAL\".\n\nThis approach should more accurately identify the presence of a table or columns in the input text."

We have, however, made efforts to tune the models to avoid these topics and\ndiminish any capabilities they might have offered for those use cases.\nWhile we attempted to reasonably balance safety with helpfulness, in some instances, our safety tuning goes\ntoo far. Users of Llama 2-Chat may observe an overly cautious approach, with the model erring on the side\nof declining certain requests or responding with too many safety details.\nUsers of the pretrained models need to be particularly cautious, and should take extra steps in tuning and\ndeployment as described in our Responsible Use Guide. §§\n5.3  Responsible Release Strategy\nRelease Details.    We make Llama 2 available for both research and commercial use at https://ai.meta.\ncom/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/. Those who use Llama 2 must comply with the terms of\nthe provided license and our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibit any uses that would violate applicable\npolicies, laws, rules, and regulations.\nWe also provide code examples to help developers replicate our safe generations with Llama 2-Chat and\napply basic safety techniques at the user input and model output layers. These code samples are available\nhere: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama. Finally, we are sharing a Responsible Use Guide, which\nprovides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.\nResponsible Release.     While many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing\nLlama 2 openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws\nupon the collective wisdom, diversity, and ingenuity of the AI-practitioner community to realize the benefits of\nthis technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\ncollaboration with the AI community.\n6    Related Work\nLarge Language Models.        The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\n   §§\n    https://ai.meta.com/llama                           35"
