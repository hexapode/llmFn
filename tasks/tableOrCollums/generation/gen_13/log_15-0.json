      "content": "The issue with the current implementation is that it only checks for the presence of '|' or '-' to determine if the input contains a table or columns. However, in the provided input, the '|' character is used for formatting and does not represent columns.\n\nTo correct this, we need to enhance the function to better identify the structure of the text. One approach is to check for consistent column-like structures, such as lines with consistent lengths and aligned content.\n\nHere's an updated function that implements this approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(inputText) {\n  // Split the input text into lines\n  const lines = inputText.split('\\n').map(line => line.trim());\n  \n  // Check for consistent column-like structures\n  const lineLengths = lines.map(line => line.length);\n  const isConsistentColumn = lineLengths.every((length, index, array) => \n    length === array[0] && (index === 0 || length === array[index - 1])\n  );\n\n  if (isConsistentColumn) {\n    return 'COLUMNS';\n  }\n\n  // Check for the presence of typical table delimiters\n  if (inputText.includes('|') && inputText.includes('-')) {\n    return 'TABLE_AND_COLUMNS';\n  } else if (inputText.includes('|')) {\n    return 'TABLE';\n  } else {\n    return 'NORMAL';\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this updated function, the input you provided should correctly be classified as \"COLUMNS\" based on the consistent column-like structure."
