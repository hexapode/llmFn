This approach is not sufficient to accurately differentiate between a table and a columnar layout.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to improve the logic for identifying tables and columns based on the structure and patterns in the input text. Additionally, we should consider the visual layout and structure of the text to determine if it represents a table or columns.\n\nHere's the corrected and improved function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(inputText) {\n  // Check for specific patterns and structure to differentiate between table and columns\n  const containsTableStructure = /(\\b\\|\\s+[\\w\\s\\|]*\\s+\\|\\s*\\n)+/i.test(inputText);\n  const containsColumnsStructure = /(\\b[\\w\\s]+\\s+\\|\\s+[\\w\\s]+[\\|\\s]*\\n)+/i.test(inputText);\n\n  // Check for specific keywords related to both table and columns\n  const containsTableAndColumnsKeywords = /(innovating|research|environmental|responsibility|climate|change|resources|safer|materials|energy|efficiency|operations|renewable|power)/i.test(inputText);\n\n  if (containsTableStructure && containsColumnsStructure) {\n    // Check if the input text contains keywords related to both tables and columns\n    if (containsTableAndColumnsKeywords) {\n      return \"Table_And_Columns\";\n    } else {\n      // If the structure resembles both a table and columns, but doesn't contain specific keywords, consider it as a table\n      return \"Table\";\n    }\n  } else if (containsTableStructure) {\n    return \"Table\";\n  } else if (containsColumnsStructure) {\n    return \"Columns\";\n  } else {\n    return \"Normal\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected function, we have added pattern matching to differentiate between specific table and column structures. We also consider specific keywords related to tables and columns to make a more accurate determination. This approach should provide a more reliable classification of the input text."
