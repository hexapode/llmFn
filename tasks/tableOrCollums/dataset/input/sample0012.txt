                               Environmental Responsibility at Apple
                        To ask less of the planet,
                      we ask more of ourselves.
                                                 Apple’s mission has never wavered. We are here to change the world.
                                                 It’s what inspires the amazing products and services that reach billions
                                                 of people around the globe. It’s what drives us to relentlessly push the
                                                 boundaries of innovation and design. And it’s why we continuously strive
                                                 to do more with less—reducing our impact on the Earth we all share,
                                                 while expanding and redefining the possibilities ahead.
