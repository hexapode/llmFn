                                                             Comprehensive Carbon Footprint
                                                             We measure more. So we can do more.
                                                             When we measure our carbon footprint, we don’t stop with ourselves.
                                                             We include hundreds of suppliers, millions of customers, and hundreds of
                                                             millions of devices. And we’re always looking for ways to make the biggest
                                                             difference in five major areas: corporate facilities, manufacturing, product
                                                             use, transportation, and end-of-life processing. In 2017, we once again
                                                             reduced our overall carbon footprint to 27.5 million metric tons of greenhous

                                                             Our environmental programs contributed to this decline in our comprehensive
                                                             carbon footprint, including reduced emissions from aluminum manufacturing,
                                                             energy efficiency, and increasing use of clean energy at our facilities and
                                                             in our supply chain. We also refine our product life cycle analysis each year
                                                             moving from industry-average data to our own data whenever possible.

Our carbon footprint tells us a lot about how we’re doing and where there are opportunities to go further. For example,
because aluminum represents almost a quarter of our manufacturing emissions, we developed a program to reduce emissions
associated with aluminum enclosures.
