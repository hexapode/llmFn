An energy-efficient facility is good, but a 100 percent
renewable energy facility is better.
As of 2014, 100 percent of our U.S. operations and 87 percent of our operations world-
wide are powered by renewable energy—which results in fewer carbon emissions.
These worldwide operations include a lot of facilities—all our data centers; all our
corporate offices, which house nearly 50,000 employees; and over 450 Apple Retail
Stores around the world—but our goal is to power all of them with 100 percent
renewable energy. So we’re tapping into energy from solar, wind, micro-hydro, biogas
fuel cells, and geothermal sources. We’re designing new buildings and updating existing
ones to use as little electricity as possible. And we’re investing in our own Apple onsite

energy production as well as establishing relationships with third-party energy suppliers
to source renewable energy. For more details, read the Renewable Resources section
of this report.
Our environmental commitment starts in the places where we work—from our
corporate campuses to our data centers. Although our facilities now represent only
1 percent of our carbon footprint, they refl      ect our values, and we want them to act
as models for others to follow. This is why we are constantly making our facilities
more energy effi   cient and aggressively investing in renewable energy. In just three
years, we’ve reduced our eff     ective Scope 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions
by 48 percent, even while our overall energy consumption greatly increased.

Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO    2e emissions capture the emissions from our natural gas use and
electricity use at our facilities—worldwide corporate offi

        eet vehicle fuel use. Detailed Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions data is provided in Appendix C.
Our approach to renewable energy is based on three principles:
Displacement. We seek to displace more polluting forms of energy in the same
electric grid region in which we operate—by putting into the grid an amount of
renewable energy equal to the amount of energy taken from the grid by our facilities.
Additionality. We strive to create new clean energy that adds to the energy already
being supplied to the grid. This generally means participating in renewable energy
projects that would not have been built without Apple’s involvement. And we make
sure that the energy we count toward our goals is not counted toward the goals that
utilities must already meet to comply with state standards, such as the Renewable
Portfolio Standard.
