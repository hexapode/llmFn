      "content": "The input text you provided seems to be in a format that resembles a table or columns, with rows of data aligned into columns. However, the function did not recognize this format as a table because the regex patterns were designed for a specific style of tables that uses special characters like '+' or '|'.\n\nTo better handle this type of tabular data, we can modify the function to look for patterns based on the presence of consistent column alignments, which is a common indicator of tabular data.\n\nHere's the updated function that accounts for this type of tabular data:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(inputText) {\n  // Split the input into lines and check if each line has consistent column alignments\n  const lines = inputText.split('\\n');\n\n  // Check if the lines have consistent column widths to identify table or column-like structure\n  const columnWidths = lines.map((line) => line.split(/\\s{2,}/).map((col) => col.trim().length));\n  const consistentWidths = columnWidths.every((widths) => widths.every((width) => width > 0));\n\n  if (consistentWidths) {\n    // Check if there are multiple rows with consistent column alignments to determine table or columns\n    if (columnWidths.length > 1) {\n      return \"TABLE\";\n    } else {\n      return \"COLUMNS\";\n    }\n  } else {\n    return \"NORMAL\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis updated function checks for consistent column widths across the lines of the input text. If the widths are consistent and there are multiple rows, it identifies the structure as a \"TABLE\". If there is only one row with consistent column widths, it identifies the structure as \"COLUMNS\". If the widths are not consistent, it identifies the structure as \"NORMAL\".\n\nYou can use this updated function to test the input you provided and it should correctly identify it as a \"TABLE\"."
