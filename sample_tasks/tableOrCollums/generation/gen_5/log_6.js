We need to update the function to check if the input text contains neither table nor columns and return \"NONE\" in that case. Here's the corrected function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(inputText) {\n  // Use regular expressions to search for typical table or column patterns\n  const tablePattern = /\\+.*\\+.*\\+.*\\+/;\n  const columnPattern = /^\\|.+\\|/;\n  \n  const containsTable = tablePattern.test(inputText);\n  const containsColumns = columnPattern.test(inputText);\n  \n  if (containsTable && containsColumns) {\n    return \"TABLE_AND_COLUMNS\";\n  } else if (containsTable) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  } else if (containsColumns) {\n    return \"COLUMNS\";\n  } else if (!containsTable && !containsColumns) {\n    return \"NONE\";\n  } else {\n    return \"NORMAL\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this updated function, when you use the previous input, it should return \"NONE\" as expected."

      "content": "An alternative approach to determining if the input text contains a table or columns is to analyze the text based on the alignment of the characters. Tables and columns often have aligned content, so we can use this characteristic to identify them.\n\nWe can start by splitting the input text into lines and then analyze the alignment of the characters in each line. If a significant number of lines have aligned characters, we can infer that it might be a table or columns.\n\nLet's implement this approach in the function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(inputText) {\n  const lines = inputText.split('\\n');\n  \n  // Function to check if a line has aligned characters\n  function hasAlignedCharacters(line) {\n    const segments = line.split(/\\s+/).filter(segment => segment.trim() !== '');\n    if (segments.length > 1) {\n      const firstSegmentLength = segments[0].length;\n      return segments.every(segment => segment.length === firstSegmentLength);\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n  \n  const alignedLinesCount = lines.filter(line => hasAlignedCharacters(line)).length;\n  \n  if (alignedLinesCount > 1) {\n    return \"TABLE_OR_COLUMNS\";\n  } else {\n    return \"NORMAL\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we split the input text into lines and then define a function to check if a line has aligned characters. The function checks if the segments of each line have the same length. If a significant number of lines have aligned characters, we return \"TABLE_OR_COLUMNS\"; otherwise, we return \"NORMAL\". This approach provides a different perspective on identifying tables or columns based on the alignment of characters."
