If multiple words are found in any line, the function will then classify it as \"COLUMNS\" or \"TABLE_AND_COLUMNS\" if the word \"table\" is also present, otherwise it will check for the existence of only the word \"table\"."

If it finds such indicators, it classifies the text as a \"TABLE\". If not, it then goes on to check for the presence of columns in the input text. If columns are found, it classifies the text as \"COLUMNS\". Otherwise, it defaults to \"NORMAL\" classification.\n\nThis approach considers the specific layout of the input to provide a more accurate classification."
