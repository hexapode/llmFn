The issue is that the function currently only checks for the presence of the word \"table\" in the text, but it should also account for the structure and layout of the text to accurately determine the presence of a table.\n\nLet's update the function to better handle this. The new approach will be to identify the presence of both rows and columns in the text to determine if it contains a table.\n\nHere is the updated function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(text) {\n  // Split the text into lines\n  const lines = text.split('\\n');\n  // Check if any line contains multiple words separated by spaces\n  const hasColumns = lines.some(line => line.trim().split(/\\s+/).length > 1);\n  // Check if there are multiple lines with the same number of columns\n  const hasRows = lines.filter(line => line.trim().split(/\\s+/).length > 1).length > 1;\n  // If there are both rows and columns, it's likely to be a table\n  if (hasRows && hasColumns) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  }\n  // If there are only columns without multiple rows, it's columns\n  else if (hasColumns) {\n    return \"COLUMNS\";\n  }\n  // If there are multiple rows without columns, it's also a table\n  else if (hasRows) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  }\n  // If none of the above conditions are met, return \"NORMAL\"\n  else {\n    return \"NORMAL\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this update, the function checks for both the presence of columns and rows based on the structure of the text. If there are multiple rows with columns, it will be classified as a \"TABLE\". If there are only columns without multiple rows, it will be classified as \"COLUMNS\". If there are multiple rows without columns, it will also be classified as a \"TABLE\". If none of the above conditions are met, it will be classified as \"NORMAL\".\n\nThis approach should more accurately identify the presence of a table or columns in the input text."

They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\nLlama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\n                                                         3"

This approach should more accurately identify the presence of tables, columns, or both in the input text.\n\nThis updated function should provide a better classification of the input text based on the presence of tables and columns."
