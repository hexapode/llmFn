      "content": "It looks like the function did not correctly identify the presence of a table in the input text. The issue is that the function currently only checks for the presence of the word \"table\" in the text, but it should also account for the structure and layout of the text to accurately determine the presence of a table.\n\nLet's update the function to better handle this. The new approach will be to identify the presence of both rows and columns in the text to determine if it contains a table.\n\nHere is the updated function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(text) {\n  // Split the text into lines\n  const lines = text.split('\\n');\n  // Check if any line contains multiple words separated by spaces\n  const hasColumns = lines.some(line => line.trim().split(/\\s+/).length > 1);\n  // Check if there are multiple lines with the same number of columns\n  const hasRows = lines.filter(line => line.trim().split(/\\s+/).length > 1).length > 1;\n  // If there are both rows and columns, it's likely to be a table\n  if (hasRows && hasColumns) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  }\n  // If there are only columns without multiple rows, it's columns\n  else if (hasColumns) {\n    return \"COLUMNS\";\n  }\n  // If there are multiple rows without columns, it's also a table\n  else if (hasRows) {\n    return \"TABLE\";\n  }\n  // If none of the above conditions are met, return \"NORMAL\"\n  else {\n    return \"NORMAL\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this update, the function checks for both the presence of columns and rows based on the structure of the text. If there are multiple rows with columns, it will be classified as a \"TABLE\". If there are only columns without multiple rows, it will be classified as \"COLUMNS\". If there are multiple rows without columns, it will also be classified as a \"TABLE\". If none of the above conditions are met, it will be classified as \"NORMAL\".\n\nThis approach should more accurately identify the presence of a table or columns in the input text."
