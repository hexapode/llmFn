For finite materials such as aluminum, we seek to recover the\nmaterial from the manufacturing process and from products at their end of\nlife. We then either redirect that material back into our own supply chain, or\nensure it is sent to a secondary materials market. For renewable materials\nsuch as the wood fiber in our packaging, our focus is on regeneration of\nsupply, meaning that we create, or protect, an equivalent supply of the\nresource that we use.\nWe hold ourselves to a strict definition of closed loop: To meet our goal, we\nmust use 100 percent responsibly sourced recycled or renewable materials\nand ensure the equivalent amount is returned to market. Recognizing\nthat this goal could take many years to reach, we remain committed to\nresponsible sourcing of primary materials as we make the transition.\nOur approach.\nFundamental to this work is our firm belief that we can transition to recycled\nor renewable materials without compromising the final product.\nTo prioritize which materials to tackle first, we created Material Impact\nProfiles for 45 elements and raw materials commonly used in consumer\nelectronics. The profiles identified global environmental, social, and supply\nrisk factors spanning the life of each material. We then combined the\nimpact profiles with data that’s more specific to Apple. Finally, in addition\nto the weighted score assigned to each material, we also considered\nadditional qualitative factors, like whether a material represents unique\nopportunities for new closed-loop supply chain models or is significant to\nthe customer experience—like the glass they touch or the paper in their\nproduct packaging.\nThrough this process, we identified a short list of materials on which to\nfocus our initial efforts. We’ve started working to close the loop on these\npriority materials, and have active projects for aluminum, cobalt, copper,\nglass, paper, plastics, stainless steel, tin, tungsten, and rare earth elements\n(neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium).\nWe’re doing more with less.\nWe are making changes to our product designs to reduce the amount of\nmaterial needed. For example, we changed the way we manufacture the\nenclosure of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, replacing the extrusion process with\na sheet forge design, resulting in a 73 percent reduction in the amount of\naluminum needed. And since 2015, we have reduced primary aluminum\nconsumption across all products by 23 percent, despite increasing sales."

This caused the function to always return \"NORMAL\" even when there was no table or columns present. \nI have modified the function to include a case for when neither tables nor columns are detected, and it will now return \"NONE\" in such cases."
