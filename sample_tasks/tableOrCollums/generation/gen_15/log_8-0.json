So we’re tapping into energy from solar, wind, micro-hydro, biogas\nfuel cells, and geothermal sources. We’re designing new buildings and updating existing\nones to use as little electricity as possible. And we’re investing in our own Apple onsite\n\nenergy production as well as establishing relationships with third-party energy suppliers\nto source renewable energy. For more details, read the Renewable Resources section\nof this report.\nOur environmental commitment starts in the places where we work—from our\ncorporate campuses to our data centers. Although our facilities now represent only\n1 percent of our carbon footprint, they refl      ect our values, and we want them to act\nas models for others to follow. This is why we are constantly making our facilities\nmore energy effi   cient and aggressively investing in renewable energy. In just three\nyears, we’ve reduced our eff     ective Scope 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions\nby 48 percent, even while our overall energy consumption greatly increased.\nScope 1 and 2 Effective Carbon Emissions\n(metric tons CO2e)\n500,000\n450,000                                                                     Default Emissions\n400,000                                                                     Total emissions if Apple\n350,000                                                                     did not use renewable\n300,000                                                                     energy\n250,000\n200,000\n150,000                                                                         Effective Emissions\n100,000                                                                         Net emissions after\n 50,000                                                                         accounting for Apple’s\n       0                                                                        use of renewable energy\n              FY 2011      FY 2012       FY 2013       FY 2014\nScope 1 and Scope 2 CO    2e emissions capture the emissions from our natural gas use and\nelectricity use at our facilities—worldwide corporate offi\nas our fl                                                 ces, data centers, and retail—as well\n        eet vehicle fuel use. Detailed Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions data is provided in Appendix C.\nOur approach to renewable energy is based on three principles:\nDisplacement. We seek to displace more polluting forms of energy in the same\nelectric grid region in which we operate—by putting into the grid an amount of\nrenewable energy equal to the amount of energy taken from the grid by our facilities.\nAdditionality. We strive to create new clean energy that adds to the energy already\nbeing supplied to the grid. This generally means participating in renewable energy\nprojects that would not have been built without Apple’s involvement. And we make\nsure that the energy we count toward our goals is not counted toward the goals that\nutilities must already meet to comply with state standards, such as the Renewable\nPortfolio Standard."
