Upon reviewing the function, I realized that the current implementation is not accurately detecting columns because it is only checking for the presence of column headers in the first line. To accurately identify columns, we need to analyze the text to check if there is consistent separation between columns across multiple lines.\n\nLet's update the function to improve the detection of columns based on consistent column separation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction doesItContainTableOrColumns(text) {\n  // Split the text into lines\n  const lines = text.split('\\n').map(line => line.trim());\n\n  // Check if the text represents a table\n  if (lines.length >= 3) {\n    const headerRow = lines[1].split(/\\s{2,}/); // Split the second line by multiple spaces\n    const dataRow = lines[2].split(/\\s{2,}/); // Split the third line by multiple spaces\n    if (headerRow.length === dataRow.length) {\n      return \"TABLE\";\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Check if the text represents columns\n  const columnCounts = lines.map(line => line.split(/\\s{2,}/).length); // Count the number of columns in each line\n  const isColumnBased = columnCounts.every(count => count === columnCounts[0]); // Check if all lines have the same number of columns\n  if (isColumnBased) {\n    return \"COLUMNS\";\n  }\n\n  // If the text does not match the table or column structure, return \"NORMAL\"\n  return \"NORMAL\";\n}\n```\n\nBy counting the number of columns in each line and checking if they are consistent across all lines, the updated function will be able to accurately determine if the input text represents columns or not."
