DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"
