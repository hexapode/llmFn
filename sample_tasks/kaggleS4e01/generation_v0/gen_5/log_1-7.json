DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

For example, we can explore how the combination of Age and Balance impact the churn probability differently for different geographical locations. Additionally, we can also consider feature engineering, by creating new features from existing ones, for example, creating a feature that represents the ratio of Balance to Estimated Salary. Furthermore, we can look into using more advanced techniques such as decision trees, ensemble methods, or even neural networks to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the input features."
