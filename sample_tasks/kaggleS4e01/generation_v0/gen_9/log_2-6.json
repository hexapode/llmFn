DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Feature engineering: Create new features or derive additional insights from the existing features that could be more indicative of customer churn. For example, you can calculate the ratio of balance to salary as an indicator of financial stability.\n\n2. Feature selection: Identify the most relevant features that have the highest impact on the prediction and remove irrelevant or redundant features that may introduce noise.\n\n3. Normalization: Normalize the input features to bring them to a similar scale, which can help improve the performance of certain algorithms.\n\n4. Cross-validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the predictive performance of the model and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n5. Model selection: Experiment with different predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods to see which one performs best for your specific dataset.\n\n6. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model to find the best combination that improves prediction accuracy.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can potentially enhance the accuracy of the churn prediction model."
