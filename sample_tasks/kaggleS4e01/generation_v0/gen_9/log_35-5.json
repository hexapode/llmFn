For example, we may assume that there could be differences in financial behavior, risk tolerance, or response to marketing strategies based on gender.\n\nWe can create an additional step in the computation that takes into account the customer's gender by assigning a specific factor to each gender and adjusting the churn probability accordingly. Here's the updated function with the addition of the genderFactor calculation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // (Previous calculations remain the same)\n\n  // Factor based on gender\n  let genderFactor = Gender === 'Female' ? 0.14 : -0.06 + (Age > 28.90 ? 0.06 : 0.08);\n\n  // (Remaining calculations remain the same)\n\n  // Adjust churn probability with gender factor\n  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + ... // Include all other factors\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nThe `genderFactor` will adjust the churn probability based on the customer's gender. This adjustment will allow us to capture the potential impact of gender on the likelihood of churn."
