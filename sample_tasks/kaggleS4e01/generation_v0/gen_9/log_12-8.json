      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, one smart way would be to incorporate feature engineering techniques such as creating new features from the existing ones. This could involve interactions between different features, creating more granular buckets for continuous variables, or deriving new variables that may capture important patterns in the data.\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify any non-linear relationships, outliers, or missing/not informative data that may be impacting the prediction accuracy. Addressing these issues can lead to improved model performance.\n\nAnother approach could be to employ ensemble methods such as bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) or boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), which combine multiple models to produce a stronger overall prediction. These techniques can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.\n\nLastly, utilizing a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a decision tree, random forest, or logistic regression, can also enhance prediction accuracy. These models can handle complex non-linear relationships and interactions in the data, leading to a more accurate prediction of customer churn probability.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, the prediction accuracy of the model can be improved, leading to more reliable insights and decisions."
