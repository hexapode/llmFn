A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. We can split the data at each internal node based on a feature's value and eventually reach a prediction at the leaf node.\n\nI will implement a decision tree approach by defining some 'if-else' conditions for different input parameters. Based on specific combinations of these conditions, we can assign a churn probability to the customer.\n\nHere's the updated function to implement this decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  if (Geography === 'Germany' && Age > 35 && EstimatedSalary < 80000) {\n    return 0.8; // high probability of customer churn\n  } else if (Balance > 100000 && NumOfProducts === 2 && IsActiveMember === 0) {\n    return 0.7; // moderate probability of customer churn\n  } else if (CreditScore < 600 && Age < 40 && HasCrCard === 0) {\n    return 0.9; // very high probability of customer churn\n  } else {\n    return 0.2; // low probability of customer churn\n  }\n}\n```"
