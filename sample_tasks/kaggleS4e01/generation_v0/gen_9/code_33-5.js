Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15808930, Surname=Chukwudi, CreditScore=717, Geography=Germany, Gender=Female, Age=36.0, Tenure=3, Balance=118098.62, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=193209.11.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  //... (previous code remain the same)

  let ageTenureInteractionFactor = (Age / 100) * (Tenure / 10);

  //... (previous code remain the same)

  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + 
                        numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + 
                        genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + 
                        customerAgeFactor + customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + 
                        geoGermanyFactor + highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterStep + 
                        ageTenureInteractionFactor;

  return churnProbability;
}
