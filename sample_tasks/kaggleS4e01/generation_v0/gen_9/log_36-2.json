(existing code)\n\n  let ageBalanceInteractionFactor = 0;\n  if (Age > 40 && Balance > 100000) {\n    ageBalanceInteractionFactor = -0.1;\n  }\n\n  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterStep + ageBalanceInteractionFactor;\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nBy incorporating the ageBalanceInteractionFactor into the churn probability calculation, the model can consider the combined effect of age and balance on the likelihood of churn. This will improve the accuracy of the churn prediction for customers like the one provided in the sample input."
