DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following steps:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing features. For example, we can create a feature that represents the ratio of balance to salary, or the ratio of age to tenure.\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle any outliers in the dataset that might be affecting the prediction accuracy.\n3. Cross-validation: Use techniques such as k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data. This allows us to better assess the model's generalization capability.\n4. Feature Selection: Identify the most important features and remove less important ones to reduce noise and overfitting.\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the hyperparameters of the model to find the best combination that improves prediction accuracy.\n6. Ensembling: Utilize ensemble methods such as random forests or gradient boosting to combine multiple models for better prediction accuracy.\n\nThese steps can help us improve the accuracy of the prediction without using a complex machine learning model. By engineering features and optimizing parameters, we can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction using a simple function."
