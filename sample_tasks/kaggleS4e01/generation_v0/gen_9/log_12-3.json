For example, we can look at the combination of high credit score and low balance as a potential factor for churn. Customers with high credit scores and low balances might be more likely to churn because they may be financially stable enough to switch to a different banking option.\n\nWe can introduce a new factor called \"creditScoreBalanceFactor\" that takes into account the interaction between CreditScore and Balance.\n\nHere is the updated function with the new factor implemented:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ... (previous factors remain unchanged)\n  \n  let creditScoreBalanceFactor = 0;\n  if (CreditScore > 700 && Balance < 50000) {\n    creditScoreBalanceFactor = 0.12;\n  }\n  \n  // ...
