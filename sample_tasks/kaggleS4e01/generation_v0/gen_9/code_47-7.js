Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15645136, Surname=Chijindum, CreditScore=557, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=35.0, Tenure=2, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=198256.54.
