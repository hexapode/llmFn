DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

The weighted sum will take into account the impact of each input parameter on the churn probability, and the sigmoid function will map the weighted sum to a value between 0 and 1.\n\nThe reason this approach makes sense is that it allows us to capture the combined effect of multiple input parameters on the churn probability and also ensures that the output is a valid probability value.\n\nNow, let's update the function to implement this approach:\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  const weightedSum = CreditScore * 0.001 + Age * 0.01 - Balance * 0.0001 - NumOfProducts * 0.1 - Tenure * 0.05 - HasCrCard * 0.5 + IsActiveMember * 0.2 + EstimatedSalary * 0.000001;\n  \n  const churnProbability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n  \n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```"
