      "content": "To solve this problem, I will use a decision tree model. Decision trees are effective for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. In this case, we can use the decision tree model to predict whether a customer will churn based on the provided input parameters. The decision tree will consider the individual parameters and their interactions to make the prediction.\n\nI will split the data based on various parameters and calculate the probability of churn based on the splits. This approach will allow us to capture the complex interactions between the input variables and make a prediction based on the analysis of the splits.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // Decision tree model based on input parameters\n  if (Geography === 'France' && NumOfProducts === 1 && Balance <= 80000) {\n    // Branch 1\n    return 0.2;\n  } else if (Geography === 'Germany' && IsActiveMember === 1) {\n    // Branch 2\n    if (Age <= 45 && CreditScore > 600) {\n      return 0.1;\n    } else {\n      return 0.8;\n    }\n  } else {\n    // Default branch\n    if (EstimatedSalary > 150000) {\n      return 0.6;\n    } else if (Balance <= 50000) {\n      return 0.3;\n    } else {\n      return 0.5;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated approach, I used a decision tree model to predict the churn probability based on the input parameters. The decision tree considers different branches based on the values of the input parameters and returns the corresponding probability of churn. This allows for a more flexible and contextual prediction based on the interactions of the input variables."
