Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15673971, Surname=Kao, CreditScore=695, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=38.0, Tenure=1, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=3830.59.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // Decision tree construction and prediction to be implemented here
  // Decision tree will utilize the input features to make predictions
  // The prediction will be a value between 0 (stay) and 1 (churn)

  // Placeholder for decision tree implementation
  let churnProbability = 0.2; // Placeholder value, actual prediction from decision tree algorithm

  return churnProbability;
