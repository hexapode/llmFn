DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, one approach could be to gather more data and re-evaluate the impact of each parameter on customer churn. This could involve collecting additional customer information such as historical transaction data, customer service interactions, or feedback surveys. By incorporating more relevant features into the prediction model, we can potentially capture more subtle patterns that influence customer churn.\n\nAnother approach could be to perform feature engineering, where we create new features based on existing data that may have stronger predictive power. For example, creating interaction terms between certain variables or deriving new metrics from the existing ones could provide more information for the model to learn from.\n\nFurthermore, we could explore more sophisticated models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, which may capture non-linear relationships between the input parameters and the churn outcome more effectively than a linear model. These models can also handle interactions between variables and may better capture complex patterns in the data.\n\nLastly, conducting thorough validation and testing of the prediction model using cross-validation techniques and exploring different performance metrics could also help in selecting the best model and improving prediction accuracy."
