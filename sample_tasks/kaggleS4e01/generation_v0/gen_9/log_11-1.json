Decision trees can effectively model the decision-making process and provide a transparent way of understanding how different features influence the prediction. We can use the input features such as CreditScore, Age, Balance, NumOfProducts, IsActiveMember, and other relevant information to create a decision tree that can predict whether a customer will churn.\n\nLet's implement the decision tree algorithm in the function to make the prediction.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // Decision tree algorithm implementation\n  if (\n    (Age > 50 && Balance > 100000) ||\n    (CreditScore < 600 && NumOfProducts > 2) ||\n    (IsActiveMember === 0 && EstimatedSalary < 50000)\n  ) {\n    return 1; // High probability of churn\n  } else {\n    return 0; // Low probability of churn\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this implementation, we have created a simple decision tree model that uses the input features to make a prediction. We have chosen certain conditions based on the sample input and other relevant factors to classify the customer as likely to churn (1) or not likely to churn (0). This approach allows us to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the input features, providing a more complex and accurate prediction."
