Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15576022, Surname=Ponomaryov, CreditScore=479, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=41.0, Tenure=6, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=93336.3.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // Existing factors...

  let ageGeographyFactor = (Age / 100) * (Geography === 'Spain' ? 0.05 : (Geography === 'France' ? 0.03 : 0.07));

  // Combine all factors
  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterStep + ageGeographyFactor;

  return churnProbability;
