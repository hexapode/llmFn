Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15749964, Surname=Tien, CreditScore=645, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=36.0, Tenure=9, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=129964.67.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // Decision tree algorithm implementation
  // ... (Code to build and apply the decision tree algorithm)

  // Once the decision tree model is built and applied, we can return the predicted churn probability
  let churnProbability = 0.3; // Example value, the actual value would be determined by the decision tree algorithm

  return churnProbability;
}
