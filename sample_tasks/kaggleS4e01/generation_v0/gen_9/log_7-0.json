      "content": "One way to improve the prediction accuracy is to use feature engineering, which involves creating new input features to the prediction model that may capture more information and patterns from the data. For example, you can create new features such as the ratio of balance to salary, the interaction between age and credit score, or the tenure multiplied by the number of products.\n\nAdditionally, you can consider using more advanced modeling techniques such as ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) or feature selection algorithms to identify the most relevant features for the prediction. It's also important to properly preprocess and normalize the input features, and to perform cross-validation to assess the model's performance.\n\nMoreover, collecting more data or additional relevant information about the customers can also contribute to improving the prediction accuracy. This could include data on customer behavior, interactions with the product, or external factors that could influence customer churn."
