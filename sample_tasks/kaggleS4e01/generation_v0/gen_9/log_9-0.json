For example, younger customers with longer tenure might have higher loyalty compared to older customers with shorter tenure. We can create a new factor by multiplying the age and tenure and include it in the churn prediction calculation.\n\nHere's the updated function to implement this factor:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ... (previous calculation code)\n\n  let ageTenureFactor = -0.02 * (Age * Tenure / 1000); \n\n  let churnProbability = creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + balanceFactor + activeMemberFactor + tenureFactor + numOfProductsFactor + hasCrCardFactor + salaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + -0.01 * customerIdFactor + surnameFactor + ageTenureFactor;\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nWith this additional factor, the function can better predict customer churn by taking into account the interaction between age and tenure."
