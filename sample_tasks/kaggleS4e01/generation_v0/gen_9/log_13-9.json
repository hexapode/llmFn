One factor that could be relevant is the relationship between the customer's age and the number of products they have.

This reflects the idea that older customers with more products are less likely to churn.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ...
