DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a feature (e.g., Gender, Age) and each leaf node represents a churn prediction. It makes sense to use a decision tree because it can handle both numerical and categorical data, and it can capture non-linear relationships between features and the churn prediction.\n\nWe'll start by defining the decision tree with a set of rules based on the input parameters. We'll then use these rules to make a prediction on whether the customer will churn or not.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // Decision tree rules\n  if (Geography === 'France') {\n    if (Age > 50 && IsActiveMember === 1) {\n      return 0; // Prediction: Stay\n    } else {\n      if (CreditScore < 600) {\n        return 1; // Prediction: Churn\n      } else {\n        if (Balance > 100000) {\n          return 0; // Prediction: Stay\n        } else {\n          return 1; // Prediction: Churn\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (NumOfProducts === 1) {\n      return 0; // Prediction: Stay\n    } else {\n      if (EstimatedSalary < 100000) {\n        return 1; // Prediction: Churn\n      } else {\n        return 0; // Prediction: Stay\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"
