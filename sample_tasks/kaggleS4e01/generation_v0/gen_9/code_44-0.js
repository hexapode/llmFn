Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15576044, Surname=K'ung, CreditScore=727, Geography=Germany, Gender=Female, Age=42.0, Tenure=8, Balance=122717.9, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=110114.19.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // ... (previous code)

  let ageTenureFactor = 0.002 * Age * Tenure;

  // ... (previous code)

  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + 
    ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + 
    genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + 
    customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + 
    highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterStep + ageTenureFactor;

  return churnProbability;
