DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

      "content": "One way to improve the prediction accuracy is to consider interactions and non-linear relationships between the input features. You can achieve this by including interaction terms, polynomial terms, or using more advanced modeling techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.\n\nAdditionally, you can consider feature engineering to create new features based on existing ones, which can capture more information and potentially improve the predictive power of the model.\n\nLastly, conducting thorough feature selection can help in selecting the most relevant features and removing noise, which can improve the accuracy of the prediction. Keep in mind that feature selection should be based on the specific context of the problem and the nature of the data.\n\nRemember to always validate the model improvements using cross-validation or other validation techniques and to be cautious of overfitting."
