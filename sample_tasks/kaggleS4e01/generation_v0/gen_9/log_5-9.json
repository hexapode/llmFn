      "content": "Incorporating the Surname parameter into the prediction is challenging due to the diverse nature of surnames and their potential impact on customer behavior. However, to ensure that the prediction function considers the Surname parameter, we can assign a unique numerical score to each surname based on its perceived association with certain demographics, cultural backgrounds, or lifestyle attributes.\n\nGiven the example surnames provided, we can allocate arbitrary numerical scores to each surname based on derived assumptions. For instance, higher numerical scores may be associated with surnames that are perceived to be more common in certain geographical regions or cultural backgrounds, or surnames that may indicate different levels of affluence.\n\nThe numerical scores for the surnames can then be incorporated into the churn prediction function through the following steps:\n1. Assign a numerical score to each surname based on the perceived impact on customer behavior.\n2. Include the surname factor in the churn probability calculation by multiplying the surname score with a predetermined coefficient.\n\nAfter adding the surname factor, the updated function can be as follows:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ... (existing code remains unchanged)\n\n  // Add surname factor\n  let surnameFactor = 0.05 * getSurnameScore(Surname);\n\n  // Include the surname factor in the churn probability calculation\n  let churnProbability = creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + balanceFactor + activeMemberFactor + tenureFactor + numOfProductsFactor + hasCrCardFactor + salaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + 0.00 * customerIdFactor + surnameFactor;\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n\n// Function to assign numerical score to surnames\nfunction getSurnameScore(Surname) {\n  // Assign numerical scores to the example surnames\n  switch (Surname) {\n    case \"Okwudilichukwu\":\n      return 10;\n    case \"Okwudiliolisa\":\n      return 8;\n    case \"Hsueh\":\n      return 5;\n    // Assign scores for other surnames\n    // ... (assign scores for other surnames based on derived assumptions)\n    default:\n      return 0; // Default score for unspecified surnames\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's important to note that the numerical scores assigned to surnames in the `getSurnameScore` function are based on hypothetical assumptions and may not accurately reflect real-world associations. This approach is quite simplistic and may not capture the full complexity of surname impact on customer behavior. Therefore, the inclusion of the surname factor should be done with caution and should be supported by thorough research and data analysis to validate its significance."
