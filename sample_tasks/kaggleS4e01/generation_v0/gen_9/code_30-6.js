Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15575146, Surname=K?, CreditScore=624, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=36.0, Tenure=5, Balance=112713.34, NumOfProducts=3, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=166468.21.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // ... (previous factors remain unchanged)

  // Factor representing the interaction between tenure and age
  let tenureAgeRatio = Tenure / Age;
  let tenureAgeFactor = 0.05 * (tenureAgeRatio - 0.14);

  // Update churn probability with the new factor
  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterFactor + tenureAgeFactor;

  return churnProbability;
}
