Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15708710, Surname=Ford, CreditScore=525, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=35.0, Tenure=0, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=131521.72.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // Implement the decision tree algorithm to predict customer churn
  // ...
  // Construct the decision tree using the input parameters
  // Evaluate the input data through the decision tree to predict churn probability

  // Return the churn probability prediction
}
