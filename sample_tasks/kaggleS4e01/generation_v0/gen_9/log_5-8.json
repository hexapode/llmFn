DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

By adding up the weighted rules, we can calculate the churn probability.\n\nFor the given input, we can consider the following rules:\n- If the customer is from Spain, then add a positive weight to the churn probability.\n- If the customer's age is over 50, then add a positive weight to the churn probability.\n- If the customer is an active member, then add a negative weight to the churn probability.\n\nBy combining these rules and assigning appropriate weights, we can compute the churn probability in a more nuanced way.\n\nHere's the updated function using the decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  let churnProbability = 0;\n\n  // Rule 1: If the customer is from Spain, add a positive weight to the churn probability\n  if (Geography === 'Spain') {\n    churnProbability += 0.1;\n  }\n\n  // Rule 2: If the customer's age is over 50, add a positive weight to the churn probability\n  if (Age > 50) {\n    churnProbability += 0.15;\n  }\n\n  // Rule 3: If the customer is an active member, add a negative weight to the churn probability\n  if (IsActiveMember) {\n    churnProbability -= 0.05;\n  }\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\nWith this approach, we can consider a set of rules and weights to calculate the churn probability in a more contextualized manner based on the input parameters."
