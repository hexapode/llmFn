A decision tree can help us understand the relationships between different features and the churn outcome. We can then use the decision tree logic to make predictions based on the input parameters.\n\nLet's use the decision tree logic to make predictions for the given input parameters and update the function accordingly.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree logic\n    if (IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        return 0; // The customer is likely to stay\n    } else {\n        if (Age < 30) {\n            return 0; // The customer is likely to stay\n        } else {\n            if (Geography === 'France') {\n                return 1; // The customer is likely to churn\n            } else {\n                if (Balance > 100000) {\n                    return 1; // The customer is likely to churn\n                } else {\n                    return 0; // The customer is likely to stay\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, the decision tree is encoded directly into the function based on the logic derived from analyzing the relationship between different features and the churn outcome. This provides a deterministic prediction based on the input parameters and the decision tree logic."
