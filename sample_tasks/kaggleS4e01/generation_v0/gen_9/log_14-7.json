      "content": "One way to approach this problem from a different angle is to use a decision tree or rules-based system to make predictions. We can define rules based on the input parameters and assign weights to each rule based on its importance in predicting churn.\n\nFor example, if a customer has high balance, low tenure, and low credit score, they might have a higher probability of churning. On the other hand, if a customer is an active member, has multiple products, and has been with the bank for a long time, they might have a lower probability of churning.\n\nWe'll define a set of rules and assign weights to each rule based on their relative importance. Then, we'll calculate a weighted sum of these rules to determine the churn probability.\n\nLet's update the function to implement this approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  let churnProbability = 0;\n\n  // Apply rules and assign weights\n  if (Balance > 80000) {\n    churnProbability += 0.3;\n  }\n  if (CreditScore < 700) {\n    churnProbability += 0.2;\n  }\n  if (Tenure < 5) {\n    churnProbability += 0.1;\n  }\n  if (NumOfProducts > 1) {\n    churnProbability -= 0.1;\n  }\n  if (IsActiveMember === 1) {\n    churnProbability -= 0.2;\n  }\n\n  // Return the churn probability\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we have defined rules and assigned weights to each rule based on the importance of the parameter in predicting churn. We then calculate the churn probability by summing up the weighted rules. This approach provides a more interpretable and rule-based prediction of churn probability."
