DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following smart ways:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining existing features or extracting additional information from the given features. For example, we can create a feature that represents the ratio of balance to estimated salary, or the tenure multiplied by the number of products.\n\n2. Normalization: Normalize the input features so that they are on a similar scale. This can prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the prediction.\n\n3. Cross-validation: Split the data into training and validation sets, and use cross-validation to tune the model hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.\n\n4. Model Selection: Experiment with different models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to see which one performs best on the given data.\n\n5. Data Augmentation: If the dataset is limited, consider data augmentation techniques to create additional synthetic data points.\n\nBy incorporating these approaches, we can potentially enhance the prediction accuracy of the churn model."
