Decision trees can be used to split the data based on different attributes and create a tree-like model to make predictions. We can use the input parameters as the attributes to split the data and calculate the churn probability based on the splits.\n\nLet's update the function to implement the decision tree algorithm for customer churn prediction:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // Decision tree algorithm to predict customer churn\n  if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n    if (Age > 40 && CreditScore > 700) {\n      return 0.15; // Low churn probability\n    } else {\n      return 0.65; // High churn probability\n    }\n  } else if (Geography === 'Spain') {\n    if (Balance > 50000 && IsActiveMember === 1) {\n      return 0.25; // Low churn probability\n    } else {\n      return 0.75; // High churn probability\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (NumOfProducts === 1 && EstimatedSalary < 80000) {\n      return 0.1; // Low churn probability\n    } else {\n      return 0.5; // Medium churn probability\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we used the attributes such as Geography, Age, CreditScore, Balance, NumOfProducts, IsActiveMember, and EstimatedSalary to create branches in the decision tree and calculate the churn probability based on the conditions for each branch. The decision tree allows us to consider different factors and their combinations to make a prediction based on the input parameters."
