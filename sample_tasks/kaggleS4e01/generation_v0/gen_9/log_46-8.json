As customers grow older and have longer tenures with the bank, they may develop stronger ties and loyalty, making them less likely to churn. On the other hand, younger customers with shorter tenures may be more prone to churning.\n\nTo implement this factor, we can calculate the ratio of the customer's age to their tenure and use it to adjust the churn probability.\n\nHere's the updated code including the interaction between customer age and tenure:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // Existing code...\n\n  let ageTenureRatio = Age / (Tenure + 1);  // Adding 1 to avoid division by zero\n  let ageTenureFactor = (ageTenureRatio > 1.5) ? -0.08 : 0.05;  // Adjust churn probability based on the age/tenure ratio\n\n  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + \n    ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + \n    genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + \n    customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + \n    highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterStep + ageTenureFactor;\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nBy factoring in the customer's age and tenure ratio, we can better account for their potential loyalty to the bank and adjust the churn probability accordingly."
