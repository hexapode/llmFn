Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15661626, Surname=Chiawuotu, CreditScore=584, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=41.0, Tenure=8, Balance=132623.76, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=67789.99.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // ... (previous code)

  let balanceSalaryRatio = Balance / EstimatedSalary;
  let balanceSalaryFactor = -0.08 * (balanceSalaryRatio - 2.0) + (NumOfProducts === 1.0 ? 0.03 : 0.00);

  // ... (previous code)

  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + 
    ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + 
    genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + 
    customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + 
    highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterStep + balanceSalaryFactor;

  return churnProbability;
}
