DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

These techniques can help capture more complex relationships between the input variables and the likelihood of customer churn. Additionally, feature engineering can be applied to create new informative features from the existing ones. This could involve interactions between variables or transformations to better represent the underlying patterns in the data. Regularization methods can also be used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization to new data. Gathering more data and conducting thorough exploratory data analysis to identify important variables and their interactions can also lead to more accurate predictions."
