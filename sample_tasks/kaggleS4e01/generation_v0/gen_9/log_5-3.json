DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

This could include creating interaction terms, deriving ratios, or transforming existing features to better capture their relationship with the target variable.\n\nAdditionally, conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis to identify and understand the most influential features in predicting customer churn would be beneficial. This could involve using techniques such as correlation analysis, univariate and multivariate analysis, and visualizations.\n\nFurthermore, using more advanced models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines, and optimizing their hyperparameters through techniques like cross-validation, could also lead to improved prediction accuracy.\n\nIt's also important to constantly validate the model using a holdout or cross-validation set to ensure that it generalizes well to new data and to consider using more data if available to train the model."
