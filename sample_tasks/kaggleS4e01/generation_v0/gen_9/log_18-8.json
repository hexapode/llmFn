Customers who are younger but have been with the bank for a longer period may be more likely to stay, as they have committed to the bank for a significant portion of their lives and may be less likely to churn.\n\nLet's update the function to include an age-tenure interaction factor in the churn prediction:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ... (previous factors and calculations)\n\n  let ageTenureInteractionFactor = (Age / (Tenure + 1)) < 3 ? 0.06 : -0.04;\n\n  // ...

By adding this interaction factor to the churn prediction, we aim to make the model more accurate and reflective of real-world customer behavior."
