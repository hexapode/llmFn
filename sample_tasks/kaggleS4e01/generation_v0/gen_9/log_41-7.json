      "content": "To incorporate the Gender parameter into the prediction, we can assign a factor based on the gender. We can calculate the impact of the gender on churn probability by considering the distribution of the genders in our dataset and how it impacts the likelihood of churn. For example, we could assign a higher churn probability for one gender if it is observed to have a higher churn rate.\n\nLet's assume that in our dataset, female customers have a higher churn rate compared to male customers. We can include a factor that adds to the churn probability if the gender is Female, and subtracts from the churn probability if the gender is Male. We can use a constant value for this factor or calculate it based on observed churn rates.\n\nHere is the updated function to incorporate the Gender parameter in the churn prediction:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ... (previous code)\n\n  // Gender factor\n  let genderFactor = Gender === 'Female' ? 0.05 : -0.02; // Assumed impact based on observed churn rates\n\n  // ... (previous code)\n\n  let churnProbability = // ... (previous computation including the genderFactor)\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we've added a genderFactor that contributes to the churn probability based on the customer's gender. The value of the genderFactor is assumed based on observed churn rates or can be adjusted using actual dataset analysis."
