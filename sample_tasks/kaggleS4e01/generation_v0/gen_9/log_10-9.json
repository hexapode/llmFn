DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "One way to improve the prediction accuracy is to consider interactions between the input variables. For example, you could create interaction terms by multiplying or combining certain variables to capture non-linear relationships and correlations. Additionally, you could explore feature engineering techniques to derive new meaningful features from the existing data. Another approach could be to use more advanced statistical modeling techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to capture complex patterns in the data. Lastly, consider collecting more data or finding additional relevant variables that could have an impact on the churn prediction."
