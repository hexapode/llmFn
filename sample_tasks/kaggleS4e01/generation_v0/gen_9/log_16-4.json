      "content": "Given the input parameters, it seems that certain aspects of the customer's information can have a significant impact on the likelihood of churn. For example, the tenure, age, balance, credit score, and whether the customer is an active member or not can influence the decision to churn.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to use a decision tree algorithm. This algorithm can capture the non-linear relationships between the input parameters and the likelihood of churn, and it can handle both numerical and categorical data effectively. We can define specific thresholds and conditions for different input parameters to calculate the churn probability.\n\nLet's implement this approach in the function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // Decision tree algorithm to predict churn probability\n  if (Age <= 30 && IsActiveMember === 0 && NumOfProducts === 2 && Balance === 0) {\n    return 0.05; // Low churn probability\n  } else if (Age > 30 && Age <= 40 && IsActiveMember === 0 && NumOfProducts === 1 && CreditScore > 600) {\n    return 0.15; // Medium churn probability\n  } else if (Age > 40 && Age <= 50 && IsActiveMember === 1 && NumOfProducts === 1 && Balance > 50000) {\n    return 0.85; // High churn probability\n  } else {\n    return 0.3; // Default churn probability\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we use the decision tree algorithm based on the input parameters to calculate the churn probability. Each if-else condition captures a specific combination of input parameters and assigns a churn probability based on that combination. This approach captures the non-linear relationships and can provide more accurate predictions in certain scenarios."
