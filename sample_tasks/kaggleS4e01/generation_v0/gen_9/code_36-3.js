Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15709511, Surname=Lo, CreditScore=674, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=57.0, Tenure=2, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=179488.41.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // Implement a genetic algorithm to optimize the prediction factors
  // Define population, genetic operations, fitness function, and evolution over generations
  // Evaluate the fitness of each individual based on how well it predicts customer churn
  // Choose the individual with the best fitness as the final prediction
  
  // Return the prediction based on the genetic algorithm optimization
}
