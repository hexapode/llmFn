The decision tree can help analyze the customer data to predict whether the customer will churn or not based on the input parameters. This approach makes sense because decision trees can handle both numerical and categorical data and can capture non-linear relationships between the input variables and the churn outcome.\n\nWe can analyze the input parameters to determine the most relevant features for predicting customer churn, then build a decision tree to make predictions based on these features. The decision tree can be used to calculate the probability of the customer churning.\n\nNow, I will update the function to implement the decision tree algorithm to predict customer churn:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  let relevantFeatures = [CreditScore, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary];\n\n  let churnProbability = calculateChurnProbability(relevantFeatures);\n  \n  return churnProbability;\n}\n\nfunction calculateChurnProbability(features) {\n  // Use the relevant features to build a decision tree and calculate the churn probability\n  // Pseudo code for decision tree algorithm\n  if (features[0] < 700) {\n    if (features[1] < 40) {\n      if (features[6] === 1 && features[3] === 0) {\n        return 0.8; // High probability of churning\n      } else {\n        return 0.2; // Low probability of churning\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (features[4] > 1) {\n        return 0.6; // Medium probability of churning\n      } else {\n        return 0.3; // Medium probability of churning\n      }\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (features[2] > 3) {\n      return 0.1; // Low probability of churning\n    } else {\n      if (features[7] < 50000) {\n        return 0.4; // Medium probability of churning\n      } else {\n        return 0.05; // Low probability of churning\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, I've used the relevant features from the input parameters to build a simplified decision tree algorithm and calculate the churn probability. The decision tree evaluates different conditions based on the input features to predict the probability of customer churn."
