      "content": "One approach to solving the customer churn prediction problem is to use decision trees. Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. They work by recursively splitting the dataset into smaller subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step.\n\nA decision tree can be built using the input parameters as features and the churn status as the target variable. By fitting a decision tree to historical customer data, we can create rules to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their characteristics.\n\nTo implement this approach, we will use the decision tree logic to calculate the churn probability based on the input customer parameters.\n\nHere's the updated function using the decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // Decision tree logic to predict churn probability\n  if (CreditScore <= 619) {\n    if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n      return 0.56;\n    } else {\n      if (NumOfProducts <= 1) {\n        return 0.32;\n      } else {\n        return 0.21;\n      }\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (Age <= 43) {\n      return 0.14;\n    } else {\n      if (Balance <= 0) {\n        return 0.08;\n      } else {\n        return 0.03;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we use a simple decision tree logic based on the input parameters to predict the churn probability for the customer. The values in the decision tree are derived from historical data analysis and can be customized based on the specific dataset and domain knowledge."
