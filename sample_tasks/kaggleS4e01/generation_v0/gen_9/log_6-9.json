In this case, we can use a simple approach to incorporate the Surname parameter into the churn prediction by assigning a factor to specific surnames that may be associated with a higher or lower likelihood of churn.\n\nHere's the updated function with the addition of the Surname parameter:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ... (previous calculation logic)\n\n  let surnameFactor = 0; \n  if (['Okwudilichukwu', 'Chiemenam', 'Chukwuebuka', 'Chukwuemeka'].includes(Surname)) {\n    surnameFactor = 0.10;\n  } else if (['Hsueh', 'Kao', 'Ch'ang', 'Manna', 'Ts'ui'].includes(Surname)) {\n    surnameFactor = -0.05;\n  }\n\n  let churnProbability = creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + balanceFactor + activeMemberFactor + tenureFactor + numOfProductsFactor + hasCrCardFactor + salaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + 0.00 * customerIdFactor; \n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this update, the function checks the Surname parameter and assigns a factor based on specific surnames that may impact the churn prediction. If the surname is in the first group, it increases the churn probability, and if it's in the second group, it decreases the churn probability. Other surnames will not have an impact on the churn prediction."
