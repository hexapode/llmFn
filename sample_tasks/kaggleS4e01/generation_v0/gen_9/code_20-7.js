Try to implement another way of doing this, while trying to stay somehow similar to previously generated function. Maybe make use of some other variable. here is a sample input:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15697876, Surname=Echezonachukwu, CreditScore=633, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=40.0, Tenure=0, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=121525.19.
