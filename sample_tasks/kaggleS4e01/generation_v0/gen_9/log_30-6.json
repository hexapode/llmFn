Customers who have been with the bank for a longer time and are still relatively young may be less likely to churn compared to those who are older and have been with the bank for a similar tenure.\n\nIn the updated function, I will introduce a factor that takes into account the interaction between the customer's age and their tenure with the bank. This factor will be based on the ratio of tenure to age, creating a numerical value that represents the relationship between the two parameters. We will then use this factor to adjust the churn probability accordingly.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  // ... (previous factors remain unchanged)\n\n  // Factor representing the interaction between tenure and age\n  let tenureAgeRatio = Tenure / Age;\n  let tenureAgeFactor = 0.05 * (tenureAgeRatio - 0.14);\n\n  // Update churn probability with the new factor\n  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterFactor + tenureAgeFactor;\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nThis updated function now takes into account the interaction between the customer's age and their tenure with the bank, allowing for a more nuanced prediction of churn probability."
