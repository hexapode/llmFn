Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15599660, Surname=Cheng, CreditScore=667, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=37.0, Tenure=7, Balance=124425.99, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=683.37.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

  // ... (existing code remains the same)

  // Interaction factor between Age and Tenure
  let ageTenureInteractionFactor = (Age * Tenure) / 1000.0 - 10.0;

  // Incorporate the new factor into the churn probability calculation
  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + geoGermanyFactor + highCreditScore + lowAge + unusedParameterStep + ageTenureInteractionFactor;

  return churnProbability;
}
