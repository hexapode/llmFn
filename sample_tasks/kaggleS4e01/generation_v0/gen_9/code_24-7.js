Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15717962, Surname=Rossi, CreditScore=759, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=71.0, Tenure=9, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=93081.87.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
  // ... (previous code remains unchanged)

  // Interaction factor between CreditScore and Age
  let creditScoreAgeInteractionFactor = CreditScore / 10000.0 * (Age / 100.0) * 0.15;

  // ... (previous code remains unchanged)

  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerAgeFactor + customerIdFactor + surnameLengthFactor + tenureNumOfProductFactor + creditScoreAgeInteractionFactor;

  return churnProbability;
