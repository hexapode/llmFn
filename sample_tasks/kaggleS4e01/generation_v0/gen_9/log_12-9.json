DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

(previous computation)\n\n  let customerIdFactor = parseInt(CustomerId) % 10 / 100; // Generate a small adjustment factor based on CustomerId\n\n  let churnProbability = adjustedTenureFactor + balanceFactor + creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + numOfProductFactor + combinedIsActiveMemberFactor + estimatedSalaryFactor + genderFactor + geographyFactor + surnameFactor + hasHighBalanceFactor + customerIdFactor; // Include customerIdFactor in the churn probability\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\nBy including the customerIdFactor in the churn probability computation, we introduce a small random element that could impact the final prediction."
