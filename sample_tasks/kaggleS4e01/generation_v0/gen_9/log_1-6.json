Additionally, if the customer is not an active member, there is a higher tendency to churn.\n\nTo incorporate this novel approach into the prediction function, the function can use weighted factors for these attributes to determine the churn probability.\n\nLet's update the function to include the weighted factors for CreditScore, Age, Balance, and ActiveMember status:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  \n  // Calculate weighted factors for CreditScore, Age, Balance, and ActiveMember status\n  let creditScoreFactor = 0.3 * (1 - CreditScore / 850); // Weighted factor for CreditScore\n  let ageFactor = 0.4 * (Age / 100); // Weighted factor for Age\n  let balanceFactor = 0.2 * (Balance / 100000); // Weighted factor for Balance\n  let activeMemberFactor = 0.1 * (IsActiveMember ? 0 : 1); // Weighted factor for ActiveMember status\n  \n  // Calculate churn probability using the weighted factors\n  let churnProbability = creditScoreFactor + ageFactor + balanceFactor + activeMemberFactor;\n\n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, the weighted factors for CreditScore, Age, Balance, and ActiveMember status are calculated and used to determine the churn probability. The factors are then combined to yield the churn prediction. These weighted factors assign importance to each attribute based on their influence on churn probability."
