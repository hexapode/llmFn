Younger customers may be more likely to close their accounts due to changing needs or financial circumstances, while older customers may have more stable financial situations and are less likely to churn.\n\nTo implement this, we can introduce an ageFactor into the prediction calculation, where the age is normalized between 18 and 92 (assuming the range of customer age) and then used to calculate a factor that represents the relationship between age and churn probability.\n\nHere's the updated PredictExited function with the ageFactor included:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  let ageNormalized = (Age - 18) / (92 - 18);\n  let ageFactor = 0.25 * ageNormalized;\n\n  // ...
