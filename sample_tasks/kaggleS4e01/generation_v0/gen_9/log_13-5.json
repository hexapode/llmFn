The decision tree uses a series of if-else conditions based on the input features to arrive at a prediction.\n\nWe can assign weights to each feature based on its significance in determining the churn probability. For example, credit score, age, balance, and tenure might have higher weights as compared to geographic location or surname.\n\nLet's update the function to implement this decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  let churnProbability = 0;\n  \n  // Decision tree rules based on input parameters\n  if (Age > 50 && Balance > 80000) {\n    churnProbability += 0.2;\n  }\n  if (NumOfProducts === 1) {\n    churnProbability -= 0.1;\n  }\n  if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n    churnProbability += 0.1;\n  }\n  if (CreditScore < 700) {\n    churnProbability += 0.15;\n  }\n  if (IsActiveMember === 0) {\n    churnProbability += 0.05;\n  }\n  if (HasCrCard === 0) {\n    churnProbability += 0.03;\n  }\n  if (Gender === 'Female') {\n    churnProbability += 0.08;\n  }\n  \n  return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we have created a decision tree based on the input parameters to determine the churn probability. We assign weights to each condition and update the churn probability accordingly. This approach provides a clear set of rules based on the input parameters to arrive at a prediction."
