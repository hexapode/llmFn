DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

Age, Geography, Gender, Balance, and IsActiveMember could be significant factors influencing the customer's decision to churn.\n\nTo update the function, I will incorporate these factors and their weights in calculating the weighted sum.\n\nHere's the updated function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    const creditScoreWeight = 0.00;\n    const ageWeight = 0.05;\n    const balanceWeight = 0.02;\n    const geographyWeight = (Geography === 'France') ? -0.21 : (Geography === 'Germany') ? 0.42 : -0.18;\n    const genderWeight = (Gender === 'Female') ? 0.31 : -0.11;\n    const tenureWeight = 0.00;\n    const isActiveMemberWeight = -0.71;\n    const multipliedWeights = -0.51;\n    \n    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        (Age * ageWeight) +\n        (Balance * balanceWeight) +\n        (geographyWeight) +\n        (genderWeight) +\n        (Tenure * tenureWeight) +\n        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) +\n        (NumOfProducts * multipliedWeights);\n\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this update, I have adjusted the ageWeight, balanceWeight, and geographyWeight based on the sample input and my reasoning for potential churn factors. The probability calculation has also been updated to reflect the logistic function formula for probability estimation."
