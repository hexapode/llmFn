Surnames often carry information about a person's cultural or regional background, which might correlate with the likelihood of churning.\n\nFor example:\n- Surnames like Okwudilichukwu, Okwudiliolisa, Chukwuebuka, Chukwuemeka, and Chiemenam could indicate African origin and be given a positive weight. \n- Surnames like Hsueh, Kao, Chi, Ts'ai, Ch'ang, and Ts'ui could indicate East Asian origin and be given a different weight.\n- Surnames like Genovese, Rossi, Cattaneo, Fokine, Manna, Esquivel, and Macdonald could indicate European origin and be given another weight.\n- Surnames like Chiu, Tung, and Hargreaves could indicate other specific origins and be given yet another weight.\n\nWe can then include these weights in the calculation to create a weighted sum that helps in predicting the churn probability.\n\nBelow is the updated function including the Surname parameter in the computation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ...
