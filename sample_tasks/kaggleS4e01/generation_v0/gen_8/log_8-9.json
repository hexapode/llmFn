      "content": "One potential way to improve the prediction accuracy is to incorporate more advanced feature engineering and analysis. This can involve techniques such as:\n\n1. Feature scaling: Scale the numerical features to a standard range, such as between 0 and 1, to prevent certain features from dominating the prediction process.\n\n2. Feature selection: Utilize techniques like correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, or L1 regularization to select the most impactful features for the prediction task.\n\n3. Interaction terms: Consider including interaction terms between different features to capture potential non-linear relationships.\n\n4. Cross-validation: Utilize techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of the model and avoid overfitting.\n\n5. Consider using more advanced machine learning models: While we are not allowed to use machine learning models directly in the function, more advanced models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines might yield better prediction accuracy.\n\nIt's important to note that implementing these techniques requires careful consideration and experimentation to ensure that they effectively improve the prediction accuracy without introducing unnecessary complexity or overfitting."
