      "content": "To incorporate the `Surname` parameter into the computation, we can consider it as a categorical feature and encode it using one-hot encoding. Since there are many different possible values for `Surname`, including it in the calculation as a one-hot encoded vector would introduce a large number of weights and potentially overfit the model. Instead, we can use a simpler approach where we assign a weight based on whether the `Surname` is common or uncommon, assuming that the frequency of a surname may have an impact on the prediction.\n\nHere's how we can modify the `PredictExited` function to incorporate the `Surname` parameter:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ... other weights and factors remain the same\n\n    const commonSurnames = [\"Okwudilichukwu\", \"Okwudiliolisa\", \"Hsueh\", \"Kao\", \"Chiemenam\"];\n    const uncommonSurnameWeight = -0.25; // Adjust the weight based on the impact of common vs. uncommon surnames\n\n    const surnameWeight = (commonSurnames.includes(Surname)) ? 0.15 : uncommonSurnameWeight;\n\n    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        // ... other weighted sum computations remain the same\n        + (Surname * surnameWeight); // Include the Surname parameter in the weighted sum calculation\n\n    const probability = 1.00 / (-13.40 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, we assign a positive weight to common surnames and a negative weight to uncommon surnames, assuming that common surnames may have a positive impact on the prediction and uncommon surnames may have a negative impact.\n\nThis modification allows us to consider the `Surname` parameter in the prediction calculation without introducing an excessive number of weights."
