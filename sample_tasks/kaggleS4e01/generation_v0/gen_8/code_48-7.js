Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15602841, Surname=Hs?, CreditScore=664, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=32.0, Tenure=4, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=163477.22.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    const tenureBalanceInteraction = Tenure * Balance * 0.0000001; // Interaction term
    const creditScoreTransform = Math.log(CreditScore + 1); // Non-linear transformation
    let probability = 0.0;

    // Perform weighted sum and transformations
    // ... (other feature transformations and interactions)

    // Calculate probability based on the transformed and interacted features
    probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-(weightedSum)));

    return probability;
}
