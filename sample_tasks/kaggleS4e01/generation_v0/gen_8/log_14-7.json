However, it is important to note that the impact of surname on customer churn might be subjective and not a universal predictor. \n\nTo incorporate the Surname parameter into the computation, we can assign weights to specific surnames based on existing knowledge or assumptions about the impact of those surnames on churn. We can then include these weights in the calculation of the weighted sum in the prediction function.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ...
