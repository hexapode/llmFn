Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15581733, Surname=Ts'ai, CreditScore=537, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=55.0, Tenure=0, Balance=123348.56, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=64448.02.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Decision tree logic for predicting churn based on the input parameters

    // ... (Decision tree construction and prediction logic)

    // Return the predicted probability of churn
    return predictedChurnProbability;
}
