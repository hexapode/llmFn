We can assign weights to certain surnames based on any historical data or patterns that suggest a correlation between certain surnames and customer churn.\n\nIn this case, given the list of surnames provided, we can create a mapping of these surnames to specific weights and add the corresponding weight to the weighted sum calculation in the PredictExited function.\n\nLet's assume that after analyzing historical data, we found a potential correlation between certain surnames and churn probability. We can add this to the calculation for the surname:\n\n```javascript\n// ... (previous code)\n\nconst surnameWeight = \n  (Surname === 'Okwudilichukwu') ? 0.25 :\n  (Surname === 'Okwudiliolisa') ? 0.30 :\n  (Surname === 'Hsueh') ? 0.10 :\n  (Surname === 'Kao') ? 0.15 :\n  (Surname === 'Chiemenam') ? 0.20 :\n  (Surname === 'Genovese') ? 0.35 :\n  (Surname === \"Ch'ang\") ? 0.11 :\n  (Surname === 'Chukwuebuka') ? 0.22 :\n  (Surname === 'Manna') ? 0.18 :\n  (Surname === 'Cattaneo') ? 0.26 :\n  (Surname === 'Fokine') ? 0.28:\n  (Surname === 'Chiu') ? 0.12 :\n  (Surname === 'Rossi') ? 0.32:\n  (Surname === \"Ts'ai\") ? 0.14 :\n  (Surname === \"Chukwuemeka\") ? 0.21 :\n  (Surname === \"Tung\") ? 0.17:\n  (Surname === \"Macdonald\") ? 0.16 :\n  (Surname === \"Esquivel\") ? 0.29 :\n  (Surname === \"Hargreaves\") ? 0.24:\n  (Surname === \"Ts'ui\") ? 0.13 : 0.00;\n\nlet weightedSum = // ... (previous calculation) + surnameWeight;\n\n// ... (return statement)\n```\nIn this example, each surname is assigned a specific weight, and that weight is added to the weighted sum based on the input surname. This allows us to incorporate the surname into the churn prediction in the PredictExited function."
