Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15638803, Surname=L?, CreditScore=752, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=32.0, Tenure=2, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=168820.27.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Assume a pre-trained decision tree model is available

    // Use the pre-trained decision tree model to make predictions based on the input parameters
    // Replace the following line with the actual prediction logic based on the decision tree model
    const prediction = makePredictionWithDecisionTreeModel(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary);

    return prediction;

function makePredictionWithDecisionTreeModel(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Replace this with the actual prediction logic using the pre-trained decision tree model
    // Example:
    if (Geography === 'Spain' && CreditScore > 700 && NumOfProducts === 2) {
        return 0; // The customer is predicted to stay
    } else {
        return 1; // The customer is predicted to churn
    }
}
