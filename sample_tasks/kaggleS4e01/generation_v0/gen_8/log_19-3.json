      "content": "One approach to predicting customer churn is to use decision trees. Decision trees can capture complex relationships between input features and the output, and they are relatively easy to interpret. By using a decision tree model, we can identify the most important features and their thresholds for predicting churn.\n\nTo implement this, we can build a decision tree from scratch and use it to predict the churn probability based on the input features provided. We'll determine the important features, their thresholds, and the rules for predicting churn.\n\nHere's the updated function implementing the decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision Tree Rules\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && Age <= 40) {\n        return 0.9; // High probability of churn\n    } else if (CreditScore < 600 && IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        return 0.8; // Medium probability of churn\n    } else {\n        return 0.1; // Low probability of churn\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we create rules based on the input features using if-else statements to predict the churn probability. We determine the probability based on the conditions met by the input features. This approach incorporates the complexity of relationships between different features and provides a prediction based on these relationships."
