DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we could consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: We can explore creating new features from the existing data that may have more predictive power. For example, we can create interaction terms, polynomial features, or derive new features from the existing ones to capture more complex relationships.\n\n2. Model Selection: We can explore using different types of models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, and compare their performance with the current approach to see if there is a model that better captures the patterns in the data.\n\n3. Cross-Validation: We can use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data and ensure that the predictions are not overfitting to the specific training set.\n\n4. Hyperparameter Tuning: We can fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model to find the best combination that maximizes the prediction accuracy.\n\n5. Handling Imbalance: If the dataset is imbalanced, we can apply techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using techniques like SMOTE to create synthetic samples for the minority class.\n\n6. Regularization: We can add regularization terms to the model to prevent overfitting and improve its generalization.\n\n7. Understanding the Domain: Understanding the domain and the specific factors that may influence customer churn can help us incorporate domain knowledge into the predictive model.\n\nApplying these approaches can enhance the accuracy and robustness of the prediction model."
