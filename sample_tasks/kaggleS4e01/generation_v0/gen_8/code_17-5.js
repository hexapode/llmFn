Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15705953, Surname=Nnaife, CreditScore=775, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=35.0, Tenure=2, Balance=96834.78, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=94620.0.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous weights and calculations)

    const ageBalanceInteractionWeight = 0.000001; // Assuming a small weight for the interaction term

    const interactionFactor = Age * Balance * ageBalanceInteractionWeight;

    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +
        (Age * ageWeight) +
        (Balance * balanceWeight) +
        (geographyWeight) +
        (genderWeight) +
        (Tenure * tenureWeight) +
        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) +
        (NumOfProducts * multipliedWeights) +
        interactionFactor +
        (HasCrCard * hasCrCardWeight) +
        // ... (other calculations)
    
    const probability = 1.00 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum)); // Using the sigmoid function to convert the weighted sum to a probability

    return probability;
}
