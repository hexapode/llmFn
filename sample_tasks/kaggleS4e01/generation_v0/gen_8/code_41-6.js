Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15714006, Surname=Gardener, CreditScore=482, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=35.0, Tenure=2, Balance=133111.73, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=79957.95.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous code)

    const ageCreditScoreInteractionWeight = Age * CreditScore * 0.0000035; // Interaction factor between age and credit score

    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +
        (Age * ageWeight) +
        // ... (other weighted parameters)
        ageCreditScoreInteractionWeight +
        // ... (other factors)
        numOfProductsWeight;

    const probability = 0.01 / (0.99 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));

   return probability;
}
