Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:

    // Existing code remains unchanged
    
    const geographyGenderInteractionWeight = (Geography === 'Germany' && Gender === 'Female') ? 0.81 : 0.00;
