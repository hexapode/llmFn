Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15690540, Surname=Udinesi, CreditScore=532, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=40.0, Tenure=9, Balance=212314.03, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=148814.54.

    let probability = 0.0;

    // Simple decision tree rules based on sample input
    if (Geography === 'France' && IsActiveMember === 1 && Age <= 40 && Balance >= 212314.03) {
