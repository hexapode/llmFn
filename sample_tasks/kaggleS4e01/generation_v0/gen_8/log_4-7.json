To improve the calculation, we need to adjust the weights assigned to different features and the overall weighted sum.\n\nIn this case, the weights may need to be adjusted to more accurately reflect the impact of each feature on the churn prediction. Additionally, we may need to introduce a bias term to the weighted sum to account for the base churn probability.\n\nLet's update the calculation by adjusting the weights and introducing a bias term to see if it improves the accuracy of the prediction.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    const creditScoreWeight = 0.001;\n    const ageWeight = 0.07;\n    const balanceWeight = 0.0001;\n    const geographyWeight = (Geography === 'France') ? -1.2 : (Geography === 'Germany') ? 0.3 : -0.5;\n    const genderWeight = (Gender === 'Female') ? 0.3 : -0.1;\n    const tenureWeight = 0.05;\n    const isActiveMemberWeight = -1.0;\n    const bias = -2.0;\n\n    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        (Age * ageWeight) +\n        (Balance * balanceWeight) +\n        (geographyWeight) +\n        (genderWeight) +\n        (Tenure * tenureWeight) +\n        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) + bias;\n\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nBy updating the weights and adding a bias term, we aim to improve the accuracy of the churn prediction based on the provided input."
