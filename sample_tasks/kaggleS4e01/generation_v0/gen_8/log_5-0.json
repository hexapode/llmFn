DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this case, we can use logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a customer churning based on various input parameters.\n\nWe will calculate the weighted sum of the input parameters and then pass it through a sigmoid function to get the probability of churn.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the weighted sum using the input parameters and their respective weights. Then we will pass the weighted sum through a sigmoid function to get the probability of churn. The sigmoid function will map any real value to the range [0, 1], which is suitable for representing a probability.\n\nUpdate function to implement this approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    const creditScoreWeight = 0.0005;\n    const ageWeight = 0.07;\n    const balanceWeight = 0.0001;\n    const geographyWeight = (Geography === 'France') ? -0.21 : (Geography === 'Germany') ? 0.42 : -0.31;\n    const genderWeight = (Gender === 'Female') ? 0.31 : -0.11;\n    const tenureWeight = 0.05;\n    const isActiveMemberWeight = -0.71;\n    const multipliedWeights = -0.51;\n    \n    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        (Age * ageWeight) +\n        (Balance * balanceWeight) +\n        (geographyWeight) +\n        (genderWeight) +\n        (Tenure * tenureWeight) +\n        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) +\n        (NumOfProducts * multipliedWeights);\n\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\nIn this updated function, we have used logistic regression to calculate the probability of churn based on the input parameters.
