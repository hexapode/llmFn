      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, it's important to consider feature engineering, feature selection, and model optimization techniques. Some suggestions to improve the accuracy of the prediction function for churn probability are:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing features. For example, creating interaction terms between features, normalizing the input data, or deriving new features from the existing ones can help capture more complex relationships between variables.\n\n2. Feature Selection: Identify the most important features that have the most impact on customer churn. Use techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance from tree-based models, or L1 regularization to select the most relevant features.\n\n3. Model Optimization: Experiment with different models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines and tune their hyperparameters to find the best-performing model for the given dataset.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation to assess the generalization performance of the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n\n5. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., the number of churned customers is much smaller than the number of retained customers), techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE can help improve model performance.\n\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n\nIt's important to note that these suggestions are more suitable for building predictive models using machine learning techniques. However, as per the constraints of this task, the implemented function uses a predefined set of weights to calculate the churn probability without involving complex machine learning algorithms."
