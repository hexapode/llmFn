The idea is that older customers with longer tenure might be more loyal and less likely to churn, compared to younger customers with shorter tenure.\n\nTo incorporate this factor into the prediction, we can introduce an additional interaction term for the age and tenure.\n\nHere's the updated function with the added factor:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ... existing code ...\n\n    // New factor: interaction between age and tenure\n    const ageTenureInteractionWeight = Age * Tenure * 0.02;\n\n    // ... existing code ...\n\n    const interactionFactor = Age * NumOfProducts * ageNumProductsInteractionWeight + tenureCreditScoreInteractionWeight + ageTenureInteractionWeight;\n\n    // ... existing code ...\n\n}\n```\n\nBy including the interaction between age and tenure, the model can better capture the potential influence of customer loyalty based on the combined effect of age and tenure."
