Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15750602, Surname=Onyemachukwu, CreditScore=773, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=35.0, Tenure=10, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=110916.15.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Assume we have a dataset with customer information and churn status
    
    // Calculate the distance between the given customer and all other customers in the dataset
    
    // Select the K nearest neighbors
    
    // Use the churn status of the nearest neighbors to predict the churn status of the given customer
    
    // Return the prediction (0 for stay, 1 for churn)
}
