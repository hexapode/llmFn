DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

The decision tree can use the input features to split the data into different branches, ultimately leading to a prediction of whether the customer will churn or not.\n\nFor example, we can use features like CreditScore, Age, Balance, Geography, Gender, and other parameters to create a set of rules for predicting churn. This way, the function will be able to capture complex relationships between the input parameters and the likelihood of churn.\n\nLet me implement the decision tree approach in the function to predict customer churn:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree rules based on input parameters\n    if (Geography === 'France' && Age <= 40 && IsActiveMember === 1) {\n        return 0; // Customer is likely to stay\n    } else if ((Geography === 'Germany' || Geography === 'Spain') && Age > 40 && Balance > 50000) {\n        return 1; // Customer is likely to churn\n    } else {\n        // For other cases, provide a default prediction\n        return 0.5; // Neutral prediction\n    }\n}\n```"
