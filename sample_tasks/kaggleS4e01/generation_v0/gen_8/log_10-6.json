DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Explore the possibility of creating new features or deriving meaningful insights from existing features that can better capture the patterns in the data.\n\n2. Use Interaction Terms: Introduce interaction terms between features that may have a combined effect on the outcome, such as the product of age and number of products owned by the customer.\n\n3. Model Selection: Consider using more advanced analytical techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods like random forests to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.\n\n4. Cross-validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n5. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n\n6. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced, employ techniques such as resampling, synthetic data generation, or cost-sensitive learning to address the class imbalance issue.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, we can enhance the prediction accuracy of the model and provide more robust churn predictions for the customers."
