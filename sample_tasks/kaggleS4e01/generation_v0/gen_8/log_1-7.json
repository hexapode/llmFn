      "content": "One approach to predicting customer churn is to use a decision tree algorithm. It makes sense because we can create rules based on the input features to determine whether a customer is likely to churn. The decision tree can evaluate each feature and create branches based on the feature's value, leading to a prediction at the end of the tree.\n\nTo implement this approach, we'll create a set of rules based on the input parameters to make predictions about customer churn.\n\nHere's the updated function using a simple decision tree algorithm:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Rules based on input parameters\n    if (Geography === 'France' && Age <= 35 && Balance > 80000) {\n        return 1; // Predict churn\n    }\n\n    if (CreditScore < 600 && NumOfProducts >= 2) {\n        return 1; // Predict churn\n    }\n\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && Age > 40 && HasCrCard === 1 && IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        return 1; // Predict churn\n    }\n\n    // Default prediction\n    return 0; // Predict stay\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, we've created simple rules to predict customer churn based on input parameters. If the input satisfies any of the rules, we predict churn (1); otherwise, we predict the customer will stay (0)."
