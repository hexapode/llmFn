DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve prediction accuracy, one smart way would be to gather more data and identify more relevant features that may impact customer churn. Additionally, using techniques such as feature engineering to create new features from existing ones, and feature selection to identify the most impactful features, could also help. It may also be beneficial to consider non-linear relationships between the input features and the output (churn), as well as interactions between different features.\n\nMoreover, implementing techniques like regularization to prevent overfitting, cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance, and fine-tuning the model parameters using grid search or random search would be beneficial. Lastly, building and testing different machine learning models could be considered, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, and then selecting the best performing model."
