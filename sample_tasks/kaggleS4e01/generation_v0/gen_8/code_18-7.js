Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15724161, Surname=Mazzi, CreditScore=577, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=27.0, Tenure=8, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=173486.39.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... previous weights and calculations

    const creditScoreTenureInteractionWeight = (CreditScore * Tenure * 0.00002);
    
    // ... previous calculations
    const weightedSum = // ... include creditScoreTenureInteractionWeight in the sum
    
    // ... previous calculations
