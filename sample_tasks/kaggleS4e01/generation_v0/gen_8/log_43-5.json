DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

      "content": "One way to potentially improve the prediction accuracy is to collect more data on customer behavior and characteristics, and use that data to refine the weights and interactions in the predictive model. For example, tracking customer interactions with the bank, their transaction history, and their response to marketing campaigns can provide valuable insights into their likelihood of churning.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating customer feedback and survey data can offer a deeper understanding of their satisfaction and potential reasons for leaving the bank. This information can be used to create more accurate predictive models.\n\nMoreover, exploring more advanced feature engineering techniques and incorporating non-linear relationships between the input features could also lead to improved prediction accuracy. This might involve using polynomial features, interaction terms, or other transformations of the input variables to capture more complex relationships in the data.\n\nIt's important to note that continuously testing and validating the model against new data is crucial for ensuring its accuracy and reliability."
