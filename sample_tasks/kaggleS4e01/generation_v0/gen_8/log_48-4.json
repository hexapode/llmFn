Feature Engineering: Identify and create new features from the existing data that could have a significant impact on the prediction. For example, creating interaction terms between variables or deriving new features from the existing ones.\n\n2. Model Selection: Experiment with different models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to see which one performs best with the given data. \n\n3. Cross-Validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.\n\n4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model to achieve better performance, possibly using techniques like grid search or random search.\n\n5. Regularization: Introduce regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as L1 or L2 regularization.\n\n6. Data Preprocessing: Normalize or scale the input data to bring all features to a similar scale, which can improve the convergence of the model and make it less sensitive to varying input scales.\n\nBy applying these strategies, we can work towards improving the prediction accuracy of the model."
