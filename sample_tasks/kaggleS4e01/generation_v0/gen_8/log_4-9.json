      "content": "The CustomerId parameter is a unique identifier for each customer, and it is unlikely to have a direct impact on predicting customer churn. However, we can still use it to introduce some randomness into the calculation by incorporating a hash of the CustomerId.\n\nWe can use the CustomerId to generate a random value that could slightly influence the prediction. For example, we can hash the CustomerId and take the modulo with a large prime number, then scale the result to be between 0 and 1.\n\nHere's how we can incorporate the CustomerId into the prediction function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction hashCustomerId(customerId) {\n  let hash = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < customerId.length; i++) {\n    let char = customerId.charCodeAt(i);\n    hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;\n    hash &= hash; // Convert to 32bit integer\n  }\n  return Math.abs(hash);\n}\n\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    const randomFactor = hashCustomerId(CustomerId) % 104729; // Large prime number\n    const customerIdWeight = randomFactor / 104729; // Scale the random factor to be between 0 and 1\n\n    // ... (other weights and calculations)\n\n    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        (Age * ageWeight) +\n        (Balance * balanceWeight) +\n        (geographyWeight) +\n        (genderWeight) +\n        (Tenure * tenureWeight) +\n        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) +\n        (NumOfProducts * multipliedWeights) +\n        (customerIdWeight); // Add the random factor to the weighted sum\n\n    const probability = 0.99 / (0.00 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the hashCustomerId function generates a random number based on the CustomerId, and then this random number is used as an additional input to the weighted sum calculation. This introduces a small amount of randomness into the prediction while still ensuring that the function remains deterministic for a given input."
