DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

      "content": "To think outside the box, we can leverage the concept of decision trees to predict whether a customer will churn or not. Decision trees are a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents the churn prediction. By using a decision tree, we can capture the non-linear interactions between different features and make predictions based on a series of if-else conditions.\n\nTo implement this, we will define certain thresholds for specific features and use a series of if-else conditions to make predictions. We will carefully consider the impact of different features on the churn prediction and adjust the thresholds accordingly.\n\nWe will also introduce some non-linear interactions between features, such as the product of two features or the division of features, to capture complex relationships that may not be captured in a linear model.\n\nNow, let's update the function to implement the decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Define thresholds for specific features\n    const ageThreshold = 40;\n    const creditScoreThreshold = 600;\n    const balanceThreshold = 100000;\n    \n    let prediction = 0; // Default prediction\n    \n    // Apply if-else conditions based on feature thresholds\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && Age > ageThreshold && NumOfProducts > 1) {\n        prediction = 1;\n    } else if (CreditScore < creditScoreThreshold && Balance > balanceThreshold) {\n        prediction = 1;\n    } else if (IsActiveMember === 0 && Age > 25) {\n        prediction = 1;\n    }\n    \n    return prediction;\n}\n```"
