Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15573319, Surname=Tung, CreditScore=694, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=33.0, Tenure=8, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=140136.44.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... existing code ...

    // New factor: interaction between age and tenure
    const ageTenureInteractionWeight = Age * Tenure * 0.02;

    // ... existing code ...

    const interactionFactor = Age * NumOfProducts * ageNumProductsInteractionWeight + tenureCreditScoreInteractionWeight + ageTenureInteractionWeight;

    // ... existing code ...

}
