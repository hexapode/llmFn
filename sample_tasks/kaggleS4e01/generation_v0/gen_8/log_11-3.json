However, in this case, given the limitations and the complexity of this approach, it's not feasible to implement a meaningful prediction based on the surname parameter within the constraints provided. Including the surname parameter may require a large dataset of historical churn behaviors associated with each surname, which is beyond the scope of this task. Therefore, for the purpose of this function, I will not include the surname parameter in the prediction calculation. If you have additional parameters that have a more direct impact on customer churn, those can be included in the prediction calculation."
