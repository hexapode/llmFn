Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15802487, Surname=Hsiung, CreditScore=706, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=34.0, Tenure=9, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=130866.95.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous code remains the same)

    const tenureProductInteractionWeight = (Tenure * NumOfProducts * 0.01);

    // ... (previous code remains the same)

    const weightedSum = (/* sum of weighted factors */) + tenureProductInteractionWeight;

    const probability = 0.54 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));

    if (HasCrCard && IsActiveMember) {
        return probability - 1.15; 
    } else {
        return probability;
    }
}
