This can be achieved by using a hashing function to generate a unique identifier for each CustomerId value and then applying a weight to this identifier. This will introduce variability into the prediction based on the CustomerId parameter.\n\nHere's how we can update the function to include the CustomerId parameter in the computation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ... other weights calculation ...\n\n    // Introduce variability based on CustomerId\n    const customerIdWeight = (hashCode(CustomerId) % 100) * 0.01;\n\n    // ... rest of the function ...\n\n    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        // ... other weighted calculations ...\n        (CustomerId * customerIdWeight) + \n        // ... rest of the function ...\n    \n    const probability = 0.46 / (-13.40 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n\n// Hashing function to generate unique identifier for CustomerId\nfunction hashCode(s) {\n    let h;\n    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++)\n        h = Math.imul(31, h) + s.charCodeAt(i) | 0;\n    return Math.abs(h);\n}\n```\n\nBy using a hashing function on the CustomerId and applying a weight to the generated identifier, we can introduce variability into the prediction based on the CustomerId parameter.
