We can use a series of if-else conditions to determine the weight of each feature and use these weighted features to calculate the probability of churn.\n\nThis approach makes sense because it allows us to dynamically assign importance to different features based on their impact on customer churn. By using a series of conditions, we can handle complex relationships between features and better capture the nuances of customer behavior.\n\nNow, let's update the function to implement this novel approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    let weightedSum = 0;\n\n    // Assign weights to different features based on their importance\n    if (CreditScore >= 600) {\n        weightedSum += 0.2;\n    } else {\n        weightedSum -= 0.1;\n    }\n\n    if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n        weightedSum += 0.3;\n    } else if (Geography === 'Spain') {\n        weightedSum += 0.1;\n    } else {\n        weightedSum -= 0.05;\n    }\n\n    if (Gender === 'Female') {\n        weightedSum += 0.15;\n    }\n\n    weightedSum += Age * 0.01;\n    weightedSum += Tenure * 0.05;\n    weightedSum += Balance * 0.0002;\n    weightedSum -= NumOfProducts * 0.3;\n    weightedSum -= HasCrCard * 0.1;\n    weightedSum -= (1 - IsActiveMember) * 0.2;\n\n    // Apply any additional adjustments or interactions between features\n\n    // Calculate probability of churn using the weighted sum\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n    \n    return probability;\n}\n```"
