DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: We can look for additional meaningful features that could be relevant to customer churn, such as customer activity patterns, customer feedback, or any specific interactions with the customer support team.\n\n2. Non-linear relationships: We can explore whether there are non-linear relationships between the features and the likelihood of churn, and incorporate these relationships into the model.\n\n3. Ensemble methods: We can employ ensemble methods such as random forests or gradient boosting to combine multiple models and improve the overall prediction accuracy.\n\n4. Cross-validation: We can use cross-validation techniques to validate the model's performance on different subsets of the data and ensure its generalizability.\n\n5. Regularization: Regularization techniques can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.\n\n6. Data balancing: If there is a class imbalance in the dataset, we can apply techniques such as oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to balance the dataset and improve the model's performance.\n\n7. Hyperparameter tuning: We can optimize the hyperparameters of the model to find the best combination that maximizes the prediction accuracy.\n\nBy considering these approaches, we can potentially improve the accuracy of our customer churn prediction model."
