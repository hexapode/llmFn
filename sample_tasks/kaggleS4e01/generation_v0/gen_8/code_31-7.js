Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15670822, Surname=Hsueh, CreditScore=613, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=39.0, Tenure=7, Balance=113146.98, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=110114.19.

    if (Age < 40 && Balance > 100000) {
        return 1; // High probability of churn
    } else if (NumOfProducts === 1 && IsActiveMember === 1 && Geography === 'France') {
        return 0; // Low probability of churn
    } else {
        // Apply default prediction logic
        const creditScoreWeight = 0.00;
        const ageWeight = 0.06;
