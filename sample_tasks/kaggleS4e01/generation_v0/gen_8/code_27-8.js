Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15698031, Surname=Hsing, CreditScore=565, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=31.0, Tenure=4, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=72993.65.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Existing code remains unchanged
    
    // New factor for the interaction between balance and absence of a credit card
    const balanceNoCrCardInteractionWeight = (Balance * (1 - HasCrCard) * 0.05);

    // Update the weighted sum calculation to include the new factor
    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +
        //... (other weighted factors) ...
        balanceNoCrCardInteractionWeight;

    // Probability calculation based on the weighted sum
    const probability = 0.54 / (-13.40 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));

    if (HasCrCard && IsActiveMember) {
        return probability - 1.15; 
    } else {
        return probability;
    }
}
