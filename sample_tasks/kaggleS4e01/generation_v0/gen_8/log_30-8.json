DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, one smart way would be to collect more relevant data such as customer interaction history, customer satisfaction surveys, and customer feedback. This can provide valuable insights into customer behavior and propensity to churn. Additionally, applying more advanced statistical methods such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forest models could help in capturing non-linear relationships and interactions among the features. Furthermore, feature engineering, including creating new variables or combining existing ones, could also enhance prediction accuracy. Regularly retraining the model with updated data and evaluating its performance against new data would also contribute to improving prediction accuracy."
