First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:\nThe result is 0 for: CustomerId=15785830, Surname=Ch'eng, CreditScore=671, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=47.0, Tenure=6, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=199376.52."

      "content": "One novel way to solve this problem is by applying a decision tree approach. A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g., credit score, age) and each leaf node represents a class label (e.g., churn or stay). We can use a set of if-else conditions based on the input parameters to mimic the decision tree logic and predict the churn probability.\n\nLet's implement this approach in the function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    if (Geography === 'France') {\n        if (Age <= 40) {\n            return 0.25;\n        } else {\n            if (CreditScore > 600 && NumOfProducts < 2) {\n                return 0.1;\n            } else {\n                if (Balance > 100000) {\n                    return 0.9;\n                } else {\n                    return 0.5;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n        if (CreditScore > 700 && EstimatedSalary > 150000) {\n            return 0.8;\n        } else {\n            return 0.3;\n        }\n    } else {\n        if (Age < 45) {\n            if (Balance < 50000) {\n                return 0.4;\n            } else {\n                return 0.6;\n            }\n        } else {\n            return 0.2;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach leverages logical conditions based on the input parameters to predict the churn probability. Each condition represents a split in the decision tree, leading to a different probability prediction. This method allows for a different approach to calculating the churn probability based on various combinations of input variables."
