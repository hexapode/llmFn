DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that may capture more complex relationships between the input variables and the churn prediction, such as interaction terms, polynomial features, or derived features.\n\n2. Regularization: Introduce regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of the model.\n\n3. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated robustly and to fine-tune hyperparameters to increase the accuracy.\n\n4. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods like boosting, bagging, or stacking to combine multiple models and improve prediction accuracy.\n\n5. Handling Imbalance: If the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., significantly more instances of one class than the other), apply techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or the use of different evaluation metrics to address the class imbalance issue.\n\n6. Data Preprocessing: Standardize or normalize the input features to bring them to a similar scale, which can result in better model performance.\n\n7. Investigate Non-linear Models: Experiment with non-linear models such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks, which may capture complex patterns in the data more effectively.\n\nBy implementing these approaches, it's possible to enhance the accuracy of the churn prediction model."
