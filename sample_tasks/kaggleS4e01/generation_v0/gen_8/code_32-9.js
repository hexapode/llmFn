Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15813140, Surname=Shao, CreditScore=643, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=75.0, Tenure=6, Balance=161371.5, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=134878.19.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous weights and calculations)

    const ageNumProductsInteractionWeight = 0.02;
    const interactionFactor = Age * NumOfProducts * ageNumProductsInteractionWeight;

    // ... (remaining weights and calculations)

    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +
        (Age * ageWeight) +
        (Balance * balanceWeight) +
        (geographyWeight) +
        (genderWeight) +
        (Tenure * tenureWeight) +
        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) +
        (NumOfProducts * multipliedWeights) +
        interactionFactor +
        // ... (remaining weighted parameters)

   // ... (unused parameter impact calculation)

    
    const probability = 0.66 / (-13.59 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));

   return probability;
