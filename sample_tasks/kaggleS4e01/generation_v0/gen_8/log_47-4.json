      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: We can explore additional features or create new features from existing ones that may have a stronger impact on customer churn prediction. For example, we can create new features like average transaction amount, frequency of account logins, or customer interaction patterns.\n\n2. Non-linear Relationships: Instead of using a linear combination of features, we can explore non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial features or interaction terms to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n\n3. Model Selection: We can explore different models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to capture complex interactions between features and improve predictive performance.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: We can use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new data.\n\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: We can optimize the model's hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best combination that improves prediction accuracy.\n\nBy implementing these smart ways, we can enhance the prediction accuracy of the customer churn model."
