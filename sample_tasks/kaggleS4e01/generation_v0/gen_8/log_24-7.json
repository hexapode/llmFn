      "content": "One novel way to solve the customer churn prediction problem is to use decision trees. Decision trees can capture complex interactions between features and provide a transparent way to interpret the results. We can split the feature space into regions that are then used to predict whether a customer will churn or not.\n\nTo implement this approach, we will define a set of rules based on the input features and use these rules to make a prediction of customer churn. We will start with simple rules and gradually increase the complexity of the rules to capture the relationships between the features.\n\nBelow is the updated function to implement the decision tree approach for predicting customer churn:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Define the decision tree rules based on the input features\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && Age > 30 && Balance > 50000) {\n        return 1; // High probability of churning\n    } else if (Age <= 30 && NumOfProducts > 1 && IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        return 1; // High probability of churning\n    } else if (CreditScore < 600 && Geography === 'Spain') {\n        return 1; // High probability of churning\n    } else {\n        return 0; // Low probability of churning\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated approach, we define specific rules based on different combinations of input features to predict whether a customer will churn. The rules are designed to capture the relationships between the features and make a prediction based on these relationships. This approach provides a transparent and interpretable way to predict customer churn."
