Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15664802, Surname=Ko, CreditScore=769, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=42.0, Tenure=7, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=101905.34.

    // Decision tree algorithm implementation here
    // ... (use the provided inputs to build a decision tree model)

    // Compute the probability of customer churn using the decision tree model
    const probability = decisionTreeModelPrediction(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary);
