A decision tree can consider the input parameters and make splits to classify whether a customer will churn or stay. By evaluating the most relevant features and their thresholds, we can make predictions based on the input data.\n\nGiven the input parameters, we can create a decision tree that considers CreditScore, Age, Geography, Gender, Balance, NumOfProducts, IsActiveMember, and possibly other features as well. Based on these features' values, we can calculate the probability of a customer churning.\n\nLet's update the PredictExited function to implement a simple decision tree model.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    let probability = 0;\n    \n    // Decision tree model based on sample analysis\n    if (NumOfProducts <= 1) {\n        if (IsActiveMember === 1) {\n            if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n                probability = 0.8;\n            } else {\n                probability = 0.3;\n            }\n        } else {\n            probability = 0.6;\n        }\n    } else {\n        if (Balance > 0) {\n            probability = 0.4;\n        } else {\n            if (Age < 40) {\n                probability = 0.2;\n            } else {\n                probability = 0.1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```"
