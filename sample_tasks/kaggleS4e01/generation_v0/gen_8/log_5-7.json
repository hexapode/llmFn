For example, younger customers with shorter tenure may be more likely to churn compared to older customers with longer tenure.\n\nTo implement this factor, I will introduce a new weight for the interaction between age and tenure, and include it in the weighted sum calculation.\n\nHere's the updated function with the new factor included:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    const creditScoreWeight = 0.00;\n    const ageWeight = 0.07;\n    const tenureWeight = -0.05; // new weight for interaction between age and tenure\n    const balanceWeight = 0.00;\n    const geographyWeight = (Geography === 'France') ? -0.21 : (Geography === 'Germany') ? 0.42 : -0.21;\n    const genderWeight = (Gender === 'Female') ? 0.31 : -0.11;\n    const isActiveMemberWeight = -0.71;\n    const multipliedWeights = -0.51;\n\n    let weightedSum =\n        (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        (Age * ageWeight) +\n        (Tenure * tenureWeight) + // include the interaction between age and tenure\n        (Balance * balanceWeight) +\n        (geographyWeight) +\n        (genderWeight) +\n        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) +\n        (NumOfProducts * multipliedWeights);\n\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nWith the updated function, we are considering the interaction between age and tenure as a factor in predicting customer churn. This update should provide a more comprehensive prediction based on the available input parameters."
