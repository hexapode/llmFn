One additional factor to consider could be the customer's tenure and their age. It's common for younger customers or customers with shorter tenure to be more likely to churn compared to older and long-tenured customers.\n\nThese factors can be implemented in the function by adding an interaction term between tenure and age, where the longer the tenure and the older the customer, the less likely they are to churn. \n\nHere's the updated function to include the interaction term between tenure and age:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ... (previous weights and calculations)\n\n    const ageTenureInteractionWeight = Age * Tenure * 0.02;  // interaction term between age and tenure\n\n    // ...
