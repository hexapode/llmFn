By analyzing the input parameters and their possible combinations, I can create a set of rules that can help predict whether the customer will churn or stay. For example, certain combinations of parameters such as low balance, high age, and low activity might indicate a higher probability of churn, while other combinations may indicate a higher probability of the customer staying.\n\nUpdating the function to implement this decision tree-like approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree-like rules\n    if (Geography === 'France' && Age <= 30 && Balance > 0) {\n        return 0.2;\n    } else if (Geography === 'Germany' && NumOfProducts === 1 && HasCrCard === 1) {\n        return 0.1;\n    } else if (Age > 50 && IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        return 0.7;\n    } else {\n        return 0.5;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, I am using specific combinations of input parameters to directly predict the churn probability. This approach doesn't rely on a mathematical formula but instead uses business logic and domain knowledge to make predictions. The function returns the predicted probability based on the decision tree rules."
