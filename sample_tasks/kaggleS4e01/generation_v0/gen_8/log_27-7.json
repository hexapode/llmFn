DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

This may include additional features such as customer interaction history, frequency of product usage, customer service quality, and reasons for prior churns if available.\n\nAnother approach could be to use more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to find non-linear relationships and interactions between the features that could better capture the complexity of customer churn behavior.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering could be employed to create new features based on the existing data, such as combining or transforming the existing features in a way that captures more meaningful patterns related to customer churn.\n\nFurthermore, gathering customer feedback or conducting surveys to understand customer satisfaction, preferences, and pain points can provide valuable insights that could improve the prediction model.\n\nIt's also important to regularly evaluate and update the prediction model to ensure it remains relevant and accurate as customer behavior and external factors evolve over time."
