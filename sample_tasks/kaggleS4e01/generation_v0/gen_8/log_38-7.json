Decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable and can handle interactions between features. By using a set of rules based on the input data, we can make predictions about customer churn more effectively and potentially uncover hidden patterns in the data.\n\nTo implement this, we can create a set of if-else conditions based on the input data and training data insights, and assign weights to different features to make the prediction. This will enable us to capture complex relationships and interactions between the input parameters.\n\nHere's the updated function using a decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree rules and weights\n    let weightedSum = 0;\n\n    // Decision tree rules\n    if (Geography === 'France') {\n        weightedSum += 0.1;\n    } else if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n        weightedSum += 0.3;\n    } else {\n        weightedSum += 0.2;\n    }\n\n    if (Gender === 'Female') {\n        weightedSum += 0.2;\n    } else {\n        weightedSum += 0.1;\n    }\n\n    if (Age < 40) {\n        weightedSum += 0.1;\n    } else {\n        weightedSum += 0.2;\n    }\n\n    // Apply weights to other features\n    weightedSum += CreditScore * 0.01;\n    weightedSum += Balance * 0.001;\n    weightedSum += NumOfProducts * 0.05;\n    weightedSum += IsActiveMember * 0.2;\n    weightedSum += HasCrCard * 0.1;\n    weightedSum += EstimatedSalary * 0.0001;\n    \n    // Normalize the weighted sum to get the probability\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, we have used a set of rules based on the input data to capture the complexity and non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. We then apply weights to each feature and compute the probability of customer churn based on these rules and feature weights."
