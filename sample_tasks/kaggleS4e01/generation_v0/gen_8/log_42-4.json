DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, one smart way would be to collect more relevant data from the customers. This could include additional features such as customer interaction history, customer feedback, frequency of product usage, customer satisfaction scores, and any relevant life events such as job changes or relocations.\n\nAdditionally, using more advanced analytical techniques such as feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and model optimization could further enhance the prediction accuracy. Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing dataset that could provide more predictive power. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) can help in identifying the most important features and reducing noise in the data. Model optimization involves tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best algorithm for the specific problem.\n\nMoreover, employing advanced machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting, random forest, or ensemble methods could also lead to better prediction accuracy, as these algorithms are capable of capturing complex patterns in the data.\n\nLastly, conducting thorough data analysis and exploring the correlations and interactions between different features can provide valuable insights and help in refining the prediction model for better accuracy."
