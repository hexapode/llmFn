DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, consider the following approaches:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining existing ones or extracting more relevant information from the data. For example, you can create interaction terms between different variables or derive new features based on domain knowledge.\n2. Model Selection: Try different types of models such as decision trees, random forest, or logistic regression to see which one performs better. You can also explore ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models.\n3. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data. This helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more accurate assessment of the model's performance.\n4. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large coefficients and prevent overfitting.\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters that optimize the model's performance.\n6. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced, use techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation to balance the classes and improve the model's ability to predict the minority class.\n7. Error Analysis: Conduct a thorough error analysis to understand the types of errors the model is making and identify patterns that can be used to refine the model further.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can enhance the predictive accuracy of the model and provide better insights into customer churn prediction."
