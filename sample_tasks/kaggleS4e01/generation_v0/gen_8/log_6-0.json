It is a common hypothesis in the banking industry that customers with a higher balance who use more products are more likely to stay with the bank. Therefore, we can incorporate the product-balance interaction term into the prediction model.\n\nHere's the updated function with the new interaction term:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    const creditScoreWeight = 0.00;\n    const ageWeight = 0.07;\n    const balanceWeight = -0.000001; // Coefficient for balance\n    const productBalanceInteractionWeight = -0.00000005; // Coefficient for product-balanace interaction\n    const geographyWeight = (Geography === 'France') ? -0.21 : (Geography === 'Germany') ? 0.42 : -0.21;\n    const genderWeight = (Gender === 'Female') ? 0.31 : -0.11;\n    const tenureWeight = 0.00;\n    const isActiveMemberWeight = -0.71;\n    const multipliedWeights = -0.51;\n    \n    const productBalanceInteraction = Balance * NumOfProducts * productBalanceInteractionWeight; // Interaction term\n    \n    // Calculate the weighted sum\n    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +\n        (Age * ageWeight) +\n        (Balance * balanceWeight) +\n        productBalanceInteraction + // Include interaction term\n        (geographyWeight) +\n        (genderWeight) +\n        (Tenure * tenureWeight) +\n        (IsActiveMember * isActiveMemberWeight) +\n        (NumOfProducts * multipliedWeights);\n    \n    // Calculate the probability\n    const probability = 0.89 / (0.01 + Math.exp(-weightedSum));\n    \n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nWith the incorporation of the product-balance interaction term, the prediction model should be more accurate in determining the likelihood of a customer churning. The interaction term allows us to capture the combined effect of the number of products and the balance on a customer's decision to stay or leave."
