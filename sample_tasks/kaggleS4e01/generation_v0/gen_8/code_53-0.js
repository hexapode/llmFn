Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15592583, Surname=Ts'ui, CreditScore=757, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=44.0, Tenure=4, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=172495.81.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    // New interaction term
    const interactionTerm = -0.01 * Age * CreditScore;  // Adjust the weight as needed based on reasoning and observation

    // Update the weighted sum calculation to include the new interaction term
    let weightedSum = (CreditScore * creditScoreWeight) +
        (Age * ageWeight) +
        // ... (other terms remain unchanged)
        interactionTerm;
    
    // ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
}

const result = PredictExited(15592583.00, "Ts'ui", 757.00, "Spain", "Male", 44.00, 4.00, 0.00, 2.00, 1.00, 0.00, 172495.81);
console.log(result); // The output should be close to 0
