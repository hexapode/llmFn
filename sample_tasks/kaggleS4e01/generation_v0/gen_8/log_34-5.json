DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, one smart way could be to utilize feature engineering. This involves creating new features from the existing data that could provide more predictive power for the model. For example, creating interaction terms between different variables, scaling or normalizing the features, or using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining important information.\n\nAdditionally, utilizing more advanced modeling techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting could help capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the features, which may lead to improved accuracy. Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can also be employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization of the model.\n\nAnother approach could be to collect more data or obtain additional relevant features that could provide a better understanding of the customer behavior and improve the model's predictive power.\n\nFinally, performing thorough model validation and testing, along with hyperparameter tuning, will help ensure that the model is robust and provides the best possible predictive accuracy."
