Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15809087, Surname=Landry, CreditScore=598, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=64.0, Tenure=5, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=195635.3.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous weights and calculations)

    const ageTenureInteractionWeight = Age * Tenure * 0.02;  // interaction term between age and tenure

    // ... (previous calculation)

    const interactionFactor = Age * NumOfProducts * ageNumProductsInteractionWeight + tenureCreditScoreInteractionWeight + ageTenureInteractionWeight;  // include the interaction term

    // ... (previous weighted sum and probability calculation)
