DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

For example, you can create new features such as the ratio of balance to salary, the ratio of age to tenure, or the interaction between geography and credit score.\n\nAnother approach could be to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, to see which one performs best on the given dataset.\n\nFurthermore, you could also consider collecting more relevant data, such as customer interaction history, customer feedback, or any other external factors that might influence the churn rate.\n\nLastly, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model ensembling techniques can also be used to further optimize the model's performance."
