Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15671165, Surname=Bibi, CreditScore=807, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=37.0, Tenure=9, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=103372.79.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Previous code remains the same
    
    // New factor: tenure and balance interaction
    const tenureBalanceInteractionWeight = (Tenure * Balance * 0.00);

    // Calculate the weighted sum with the new factor
