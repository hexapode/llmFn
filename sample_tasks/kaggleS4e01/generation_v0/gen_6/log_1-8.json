      "content": "One potential way to improve the prediction accuracy is to incorporate feature engineering, which involves creating new input features from the existing data. For example, you could create new features such as the ratio of balance to estimated salary, the ratio of age to tenure, or the interaction between credit score and the number of products.\n\nAnother approach could be to use more advanced techniques such as decision trees, ensemble methods (e.g., random forests), or gradient boosting. These methods can capture complex relationships between the input features and the target variable, potentially leading to better prediction accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, you could consider collecting additional relevant data that may have a predictive power on customer churn, such as customer interaction history, product usage patterns, or customer feedback.\n\nLastly, conducting thorough data analysis and exploration to identify the most important features and their relationships to the target variable can also lead to better predictive models."
