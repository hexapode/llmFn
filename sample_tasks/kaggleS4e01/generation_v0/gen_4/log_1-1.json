Customers who have been with the bank for a longer period of time may be less likely to churn compared to new customers. We can incorporate this into our prediction by assigning a negative weight to the tenure parameter, indicating that longer tenure reduces the likelihood of churn.\n\nHere's the updated function with the tenure parameter included in the calculation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  let probability = 0;\n\n  probability = (CreditScore * 0.1) + (Age * 0.2) - (Balance * 0.15) - (NumOfProducts * 0.05) - (IsActiveMember ? 0.1 : 0.05) - (Tenure * 0.03) + (EstimatedSalary * 0.08);\n\n  return probability;\n}\n```\n\nThis addition allows the function to take into account the impact of tenure on the prediction of customer churn."
