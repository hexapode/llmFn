Customers who have been with the bank for a longer period of time and are not actively using their account may be more likely to churn.\n\nWe can introduce a factor that combines tenure and activity level to improve the prediction. We can consider the product of tenure and (1 - IsActiveMember) to capture this interaction.\n\nHere's the updated function incorporating this factor:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  \n  let probability = 0;\n\n  // Introduce the factor combining tenure and activity level\n  let tenureActivityFactor = Tenure * (1 - IsActiveMember);\n\n  probability = (CreditScore * 0.1) + (Age * 0.2) - (Balance * 0.15) - (NumOfProducts * 0.05) + (EstimatedSalary * 0.08) - (tenureActivityFactor * 0.1);\n\n  return probability;\n}\n```\n\nWith this update, the function incorporates the interaction between tenure and activity level to make a more informed prediction about customer churn."
