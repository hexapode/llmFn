Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15671149, Surname=Fiorentini, CreditScore=850, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=36.0, Tenure=3, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=129898.54.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    
    // Decision tree algorithm implementation
    // ... (code for building and using a decision tree)
    // Use the input features to predict customer churn
    
    // Assume we have trained the decision tree model and use it to make predictions
    let predictedChurn = decisionTreePredict(CreditScore, Age, Balance, Geography, Gender, NumOfProducts, IsActiveMember);
    
    return predictedChurn;
