Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15751774, Surname=Tsao, CreditScore=663, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=36.0, Tenure=3, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=121061.47.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Decision tree algorithm implementation to predict customer churn
    if (Geography === 'Germany' && NumOfProducts > 1 && Age > 30) {
        return 0.9; // High likelihood of churn
    } else if (CreditScore < 600 && Balance === 0) {
        return 0.8; // Moderate likelihood of churn
    } else if (IsActiveMember === 0) {
        return 0.7; // Moderate likelihood of churn
