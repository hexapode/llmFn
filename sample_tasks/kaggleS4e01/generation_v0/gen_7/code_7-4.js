function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Decision tree logic to predict customer churn
    if (Geography === 'Germany' && NumOfProducts > 1) {
        return 0.8; // High probability of churn
    } else if (CreditScore < 650 && Age > 30 && Age < 40) {
