A decision tree can help in determining the likelihood of customer churn based on the input parameters. It is a simple and interpretable model that can capture complex relationships between the input features and the target variable.\n\nI will update the function to implement a decision tree algorithm for predicting customer churn. The decision tree will use conditional statements based on the input features to make predictions about customer churn likelihood.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree algorithm implementation to predict customer churn\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && NumOfProducts > 1 && Age > 30) {\n        return 0.9; // High likelihood of churn\n    } else if (CreditScore < 600 && Balance === 0) {\n        return 0.8; // Moderate likelihood of churn\n    } else if (IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        return 0.7; // Moderate likelihood of churn\n    } else {\n        return 0.1; // Low likelihood of churn\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, I've implemented a simple decision tree algorithm using conditional statements based on the input features. This allows us to make predictions about the likelihood of customer churn without using complex mathematical formulas or coefficients. The decision tree captures relationships between the input features and the churn likelihood, providing a straightforward and interpretable solution."
