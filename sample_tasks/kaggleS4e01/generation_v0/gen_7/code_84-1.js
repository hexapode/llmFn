Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:

    // Here, the decision tree algorithm would be implemented, the trained decision tree would be used to make predictions for the given input data.
    // Since implementing a decision tree algorithm from scratch is beyond the scope of this simple function, a pre-trained decision tree model could be used instead.

    // Assuming a pre-trained decision tree model is available
    // Use the pre-trained decision tree model to make predictions

    // Sample prediction using a pre-trained model
    const predictedChurnProbability = 0.2; // Sample prediction probability for the given input
