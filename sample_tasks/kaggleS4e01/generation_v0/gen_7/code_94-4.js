Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15653958, Surname=Hargreaves, CreditScore=738, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=27.0, Tenure=1, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=130131.89.

    // Use the decision tree model to predict the likelihood of churning
