It is reasonable to assume that younger customers with more products may be more likely to churn compared to older customers with fewer products, as the former may be more open to switching to different services.\n\nLet's update the function to include this interaction:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    \n    const coefficients = {\n        // ... other coefficients\n        Age_NumOfProducts_Interaction: -0.05\n    };\n\n    let ageNumProductsInteraction = Age * NumOfProducts * coefficients.Age_NumOfProducts_Interaction;\n\n    let linearCombination = (\n        // ... other linear combination calculation\n        + ageNumProductsInteraction\n    );\n\n    const probability = 0.10 / (1000.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nThis interaction term allows the model to consider the combined effect of age and number of products on the likelihood of churn. This should improve the accuracy of the prediction by capturing the nuanced relationship between these two factors."
