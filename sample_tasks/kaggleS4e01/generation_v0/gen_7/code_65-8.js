Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15658100, Surname=Tung, CreditScore=695, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=42.0, Tenure=0, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=140724.64.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // (Previous coefficients remain the same)
    
    // ... (Previous variable calculations remain the same)

    // New factor for age-geography interaction
    let ageGeographyInteraction = 0.00;
    if (Age <= 30.00 && Geography === 'France') {
        ageGeographyInteraction = -1.25;
    } else if (Age > 50.00 && Geography === 'Germany') {
        ageGeographyInteraction = 1.60;
    } else {
        ageGeographyInteraction = 0.30;
    }

    // Include age-geography interaction in the linear combination
    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (Previous linear combination calculation)
        + coefficients.NewParameterImpact * newParameter
        + ageGeographyInteraction // Include age-geography interaction
        // ... (Remaining calculation remains the same)
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.01 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
