      "content": "One factor that could be relevant to predict customer churn is the interaction between Age and Balance. Younger customers with higher account balances might be less likely to churn, as they have more time to benefit from their investments. To implement this, I will introduce a new parameter called AgeBalanceImpact, which will be computed based on the interaction between Age and Balance.\n\nHere is the updated function to include the AgeBalanceImpact factor:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n\n    const coefficients = { /* ... */ };\n\n    // existing code...\n\n    let ageBalanceImpact = (Age * Balance * coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact) * (IsActiveMember === 1.00 ? 2.00 : 1.00);\n\n    // existing code...\n\n    let linearCombination = (\n        /* ... */\n        surnameValue + ageBalanceImpact + coefficients.CreditScoreImpact * CreditScore +\n        unusedParameterImpact +\n        /* ... */\n    );\n\n    const probability = 1.00 / (1.01 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));\n    \n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, I calculate the impact of Age and Balance interaction by multiplying Age, Balance, and a predefined coefficient (AgeBalanceImpact), and adjust the impact based on the IsActiveMember parameter. This factor will be included in the linear combination to compute the probability of customer churn.\n\nBy adding the interaction between Age and Balance, the model may be able to better predict customer churn based on the provided input parameters."
