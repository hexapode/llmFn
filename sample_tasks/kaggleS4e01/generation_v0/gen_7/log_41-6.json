A higher ratio may indicate a more stable and long-term customer, while a lower ratio may indicate a potential churn. Additionally, the balance could also indicate the customer's engagement and commitment to the bank.\n\nI will also consider the effect of the number of products the customer has with the bank. A higher number of products may indicate a deeper relationship with the bank, potentially reducing the likelihood of churn.\n\nI will implement these factors into the function by calculating the tenure/age ratio and including it in the linear combination.
