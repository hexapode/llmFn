      "content": "One novel way to solve the customer churn prediction problem is by using a decision tree algorithm. Decision trees are non-linear models that can capture complex relationships between input features and the target variable. They work by recursively partitioning the input space based on the features, and then make predictions based on the average outcome of the samples in each partition.\n\nTo implement this approach in the function, we would use a set of rules to partition the input space based on certain feature thresholds, and then calculate the probability of churn based on the average outcome for each partition.\n\nHere's the updated function using a decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree rules\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && Age <= 35 && IsActiveMember === 1) {\n        return 0.1; // Low probability of churn\n    } else if (CreditScore <= 600 && NumOfProducts >= 2) {\n        return 0.9; // High probability of churn\n    } else {\n        return 0.5; // Neutral probability of churn\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we use a set of if-else rules to partition the input space based on specific feature thresholds and calculate the probability of churn based on the average outcome for each partition. By using this decision tree approach, we can capture non-linear relationships between the input features and the churn prediction, and make more accurate predictions based on the provided input."
