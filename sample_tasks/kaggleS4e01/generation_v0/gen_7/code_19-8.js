Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15704483, Surname=Palerma, CreditScore=594, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=36.0, Tenure=1, Balance=160376.61, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=197984.58.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (existing code remains the same)

    let ageBalanceImpact = Age * Balance * coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact;

    // ... (remaining code remains the same)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing code remains the same)
        coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact * ageBalanceImpact // Include the interaction effect
    );

    const probability = 0.16 / (2.02 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
