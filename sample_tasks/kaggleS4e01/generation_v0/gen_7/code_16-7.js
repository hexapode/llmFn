Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15768124, Surname=Ts'ui, CreditScore=628, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=34.0, Tenure=2, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=91844.29.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    const coefficients = {
        //... (other coefficients remain the same)
        NewParameterImpact: 0.02,
        //... (other coefficients remain the same)
    };

    // ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    let newParameter = (Age * Tenure) / (NumOfProducts + Balance);

    // ... (the rest of the function remains the same)
}
