Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15710138, Surname=Paterson, CreditScore=718, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=39.0, Tenure=6, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=63889.1.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Decision tree algorithm implementation
    // ...
    // Include the code to build and traverse the decision tree using the input features
    // ...

    // After traversing the decision tree, calculate the probability of churning based on the final node reached

    const probability = 0.85; // Replace with the calculated probability

    return probability;
