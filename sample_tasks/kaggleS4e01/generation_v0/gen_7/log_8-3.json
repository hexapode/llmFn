DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we could consider the following smart approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: We can create new features by combining or transforming existing features, such as creating interaction terms, scaling the features appropriately, or encoding categorical variables more effectively.\n\n2. Model Selection: We can try different models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, and compare their performance to choose the best model for the prediction task.\n\n3. Cross-Validation: We can use cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of the model and avoid overfitting to the training data.\n\n4. Hyperparameter Tuning: We can optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model using techniques like grid search or random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.\n\n5. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced, we can use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation to balance the classes and improve the model's ability to predict the minority class (churn in this case).\n\n6. Ensemble Methods: We can create ensemble models by combining multiple models to make more accurate predictions.\n\n7. Regularization: Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.\n\nBy implementing these approaches, we can improve the prediction accuracy of the model and provide more reliable churn predictions for the customers."
