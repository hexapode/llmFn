Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15758073, Surname=Calabresi, CreditScore=606, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=35.0, Tenure=9, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=111687.57.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    const coefficients = {
        // ... (other coefficients remain unchanged)
        GeographyGenderImpact: 0.24
    };

    // ... (other variable calculations remain unchanged)

    let geographyGenderImpact = 0.00;
    if (Geography === 'Germany' && Gender === 'Male') {
        geographyGenderImpact = 1.10;
    } else if (Geography === 'Spain' && Gender === 'Female') {
        geographyGenderImpact = 0.95;
    } else {
        geographyGenderImpact = -0.05;
    }

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (other parts of the linear combination remain unchanged)
        + coefficients.GeographyGenderImpact * geographyGenderImpact

    const probability = 0.16 / (2.02 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));
