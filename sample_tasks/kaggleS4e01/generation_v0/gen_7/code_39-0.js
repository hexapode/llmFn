Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15641830, Surname=Calabresi, CreditScore=662, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=45.0, Tenure=3, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=70984.75.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    let ageTenureInteraction = Age * Tenure * 0.03;  // Define the interaction effect

    // ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (coefficients * parameters as before)
        ageTenureInteraction +  // Include the interaction effect
        coefficients.CreditScoreImpact * CreditScore +
        // ... (other terms as before)
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.01 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
