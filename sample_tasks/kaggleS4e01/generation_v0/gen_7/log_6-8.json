A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g., Age > 30), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (e.g., churn or stay). By recursively partitioning the data based on the most significant attributes, a decision tree can provide a clear prediction path for customer churn.\n\nI will update the function to implement a decision tree model to predict customer churn. I will define the decision tree rules based on the provided input parameters and calculate the probability of churn based on these rules.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Implement decision tree rules based on input parameters\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && IsActiveMember === 1 && EstimatedSalary > 100000) {\n        return 0.8; // High probability of churn\n    } else if (CreditScore < 650 && NumOfProducts > 1) {\n        return 0.6; // Moderate probability of churn\n    } else if (Age > 50 || Balance > 100000) {\n        return 0.4; // Low probability of churn\n    } else {\n        return 0.1; // Very low probability of churn\n    }\n}\n```"
