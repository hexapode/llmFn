Decision trees are a predictive modeling approach that learns to partition the data into subsets that are more homogeneous with respect to the target variable, in this case, customer churn.\n\nWe can build a decision tree based on the input parameters, and each node of the tree represents a question about a certain parameter. Based on the answers to these questions, we can navigate through the tree to reach a leaf node that provides the prediction for customer churn.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree model parameters and logic\n    let probability = 0.00;\n  \n    if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n        if (NumOfProducts <= 1) {\n            probability = 0.80;\n        } else if (NumOfProducts === 2 && Balance <= 50000 && EstimatedSalary <= 100000) {\n            probability = 0.60;\n        } else {\n            probability = 0.40;\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === 'Spain') {\n        if (CreditScore <= 500) {\n            probability = 0.90;\n        } else {\n            probability = 0.70;\n        }\n    } else {\n        if (IsActiveMember === 1 && Age <= 40) {\n            probability = 0.20;\n        } else {\n            probability = 0.10;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```"
