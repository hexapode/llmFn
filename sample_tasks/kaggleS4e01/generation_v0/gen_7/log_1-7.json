      "content": "The Surname parameter is a categorical variable, and including it directly in the calculation of the linear combination may not provide meaningful results. However, we can encode the Surname parameter into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding. This way, we can include the Surname parameter in the computation by treating it as a set of binary variables representing each possible surname.\n\nHere's the updated function with the inclusion of the Surname parameter using one-hot encoding:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ... (previous code)\n    \n    // One-hot encoding for Surname parameter\n    let surnameValue = 0;\n    if (Surname === 'Okwudilichukwu') {\n        surnameValue = 1;\n    } else if (Surname === 'Okwudiliolisa') {\n        surnameValue = 2;\n    } else if (Surname === 'Hsueh') {\n        surnameValue = 3;\n    }\n    // ... (similar checks for other surnames)\n\n    // Include encoded Surname parameter in the linear combination\n    const weightSurname = [0.03, 0.04, 0.02, ...];  // Weights for each possible surname value\n    const surnameLinearCombination = weightSurname[surnameValue - 1];  // Subtract 1 to map to array index\n\n    const finalLinearCombination = linearCombination + surnameLinearCombination;\n\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-finalLinearCombination));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we added one-hot encoding for the Surname parameter, and included it in the calculation of the final linear combination. This allows us to incorporate the Surname parameter into the prediction computation."
