It makes sense to assume that long-standing customers are less likely to churn compared to newer customers. \n\nTo incorporate this factor into the prediction, I will calculate a new parameter by multiplying the age and tenure together and then dividing by the number of products and the balance. This new parameter reflects the relationship between the customer's age, tenure, and their engagement with the bank.\n\nHere's the updated function with this new parameter included:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n\n    const coefficients = {\n        //...
