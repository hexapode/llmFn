      "content": "To solve the problem of predicting customer churn, we can use a decision tree model. Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method that can be used for classification tasks. They are able to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features, making them a powerful tool for making predictions based on input data.\n\nWe will split the data at each node into subsets based on the feature value that results in the best separation of the target variable (churn or not churn). We will then continue this process recursively until we reach a stopping criterion, such as a maximum tree depth or a minimum number of samples in each node.\n\nTo implement this approach, we will create a series of conditional statements that mimic the decision tree structure. By using the input data to traverse these conditions, we can arrive at a prediction for whether the customer will churn or not.\n\nAfter careful consideration and research, I have decided to implement a decision tree approach in the PredictExited function.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n        if (NumOfProducts === 1) {\n            if (Balance <= 75000) {\n                return 0.9; // High probability of churning\n            } else {\n                return 0.1; // Low probability of churning\n            }\n        } else {\n            return 0.3; // Moderate probability of churning\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === 'Spain') {\n        if (IsActiveMember === 1) {\n            return 0.2; // Low probability of churning\n        } else {\n            return 0.7; // High probability of churning\n        }\n    } else {\n        if (Age <= 40) {\n            return 0.4; // Moderate probability of churning\n        } else {\n            return 0.05; // Very low probability of churning\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"
