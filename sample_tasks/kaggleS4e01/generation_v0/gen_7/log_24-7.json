      "content": "Upon reviewing the sample input, one factor that could make sense for this prediction is the interaction between the customer's age and their balance. It is possible that older customers with higher account balances may be less likely to churn, as they have accumulated a significant amount of wealth and may be less inclined to switch to a different bank.\n\nTo incorporate this interaction into the prediction, I will introduce a new parameter called \"AgeBalanceInteraction\" and calculate its impact on the churn prediction based on the interaction between Age and Balance.\n\nHere's the updated function to include the AgeBalanceInteraction parameter:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n\n    // ... (existing code remains unchanged)\n\n    let ageBalanceInteraction = Age * (Balance / 10000);  // Interaction between Age and Balance\n\n    let linearCombination = (\n        // ... (existing code for linear combination remains unchanged)\n        coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact * ageBalanceInteraction  // Include impact of Age-Balance interaction\n    );\n\n    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nBy including the interaction between Age and Balance as a new parameter \"AgeBalanceInteraction\" and considering its impact on the prediction, the function now incorporates the potential influence of this factor on the likelihood of a customer churning."
