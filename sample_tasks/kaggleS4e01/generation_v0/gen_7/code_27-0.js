Try to think how Gender parameter could impact the prediction, then add a step in the computation using the parameter Gender. Here as some value it can take: Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Female, Male, Male, Male, Female, Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Male, Male, Female, Male.

// Considering Gender as a parameter in the prediction, we can assign different impact values based on the gender.
// For example, we could give a higher impact value for Male gender compared to Female gender, assuming that historical data shows a different churn rate based on gender.

let genderImpact = 0.00;
if (Gender === 'Male') {
    genderImpact = 1.50;  // Assigning a higher impact for Male gender
} else {
    genderImpact = -0.50;  // Assigning a lower impact for Female gender
}
// ...
// Adding genderImpact into the linear combination calculation
// ...
linearCombination += coefficients.GenderImpact * genderImpact;
