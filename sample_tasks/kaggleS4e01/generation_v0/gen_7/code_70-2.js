Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15671766, Surname=Hsueh, CreditScore=708, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=29.0, Tenure=7, Balance=95727.05, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=92220.12.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    // New parameter calculation
    let creditScoreBalanceFactor = CreditScore * Balance;

    // Include the new parameter in the linear combination
    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (previous coefficients and parameters) ...
        coefficients.CreditScoreBalanceFactor * creditScoreBalanceFactor
    );

    // ... (rest of the code remains unchanged) ...
}
