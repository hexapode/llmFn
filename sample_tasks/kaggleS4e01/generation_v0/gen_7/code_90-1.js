Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15790763, Surname=Yeh, CreditScore=593, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=39.0, Tenure=4, Balance=149961.99, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=156821.72.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (existing code)

    let ageBalanceImpact = (Age * Balance * coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact) * (IsActiveMember === 1.00 ? 2.00 : 1.00);

    // ... (existing code)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing linear combination calculation)
        + ageBalanceImpact
        // ... (other terms)
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
