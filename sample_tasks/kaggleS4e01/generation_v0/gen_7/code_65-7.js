Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15658713, Surname=Chukwuemeka, CreditScore=662, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=27.0, Tenure=1, Balance=122291.1, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=187976.4.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    const coefficients = {
        // previous coefficients remain unchanged
        // ...
        CreditScoreImpact: -0.0045,
        AgeImpact: 0.02,
        TenureImpact: -0.05
    };

    // ... other calculations remain unchanged

    let linearCombination = (
