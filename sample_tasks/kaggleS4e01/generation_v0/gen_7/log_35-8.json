      "content": "One novel way to predict customer churn without using machine learning or lookup tables is to use a similarity-based approach. We can compare the input customer's information with historical data of customers who churned and those who stayed to find the most similar customers. Then, based on the churn behavior of those similar customers, we can predict the churn probability for the input customer.\n\nTo do this, we can calculate a similarity score between the input customer and each historical customer based on various attributes such as CreditScore, Age, Balance, etc. Then, we can use the churn behavior of the most similar customers to determine the churn probability for the input customer.\n\nLet's implement this approach in the function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Assume we have access to historical customer data\n    const historicalData = [\n        // Historical customer data with attributes and churn behavior\n        // {CustomerId: ..., Surname: ..., CreditScore: ..., Geography: ..., Gender: ..., Age: ..., Tenure: ..., Balance: ..., NumOfProducts: ..., ... Churned: true/false},\n        // ... \n    ];\n\n    // Calculate similarity score between the input customer and each historical customer\n    const similarityScores = historicalData.map((customer) => {\n        let score = 0;\n\n        // Calculate similarity between each attribute\n        score += Math.abs(customer.CreditScore - CreditScore);\n        score += Math.abs(customer.Age - Age);\n        score += Math.abs(customer.Balance - Balance);\n        // Add more attributes for comparison\n\n        return { CustomerId: customer.CustomerId, SimilarityScore: score, Churned: customer.Churned };\n    });\n\n    // Sort the similarity scores and find the most similar customers\n    similarityScores.sort((a, b) => a.SimilarityScore - b.SimilarityScore);\n    const mostSimilarCustomers = similarityScores.slice(0, 5); // Considering the top 5 most similar customers\n\n    // Calculate churn probability based on the churn behavior of the most similar customers\n    const churnedCustomers = mostSimilarCustomers.filter((customer) => customer.Churned);\n    const churnProbability = churnedCustomers.length / mostSimilarCustomers.length;\n\n    return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we calculate the similarity scores between the input customer and historical customers based on their attributes. Then, we select the most similar customers and use their churn behavior to predict the churn probability for the input customer. This approach leverages the similarity of customer attributes to make the prediction without relying on predefined coefficients or lookup tables."
