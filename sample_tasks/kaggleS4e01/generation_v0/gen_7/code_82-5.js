Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15678727, Surname=Tan, CreditScore=770, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=45.0, Tenure=4, Balance=110765.68, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=26163.74.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Perform decision tree logic with historical data to predict churn probability
    let churnProbability = yourDecisionTreeAlgorithm(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary);

    return churnProbability;
