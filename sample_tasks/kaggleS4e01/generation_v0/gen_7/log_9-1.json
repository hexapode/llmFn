DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

The calculation of the linear combination was not accurate, as the coefficients and impacts were not properly considered.\n2. The use of the last digit of the CustomerId to calculate the impact was flawed, as it didn't have a significant impact on the prediction.\n\nConsidering the above, I have made the following updates to the function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    \n    const coefficients = {\n        CreditScore: 0.004,\n        Age: 0.06,\n        Tenure: -0.015,\n        NumOfProducts: -0.3,\n        HasCrCard: -0.2,\n        IsActiveMember: -0.8,\n        GeographyImpact: 0.4, \n        GenderImpact: -0.15, \n        SurnameImpact: 0.04,\n        // NewParameterImpact: 0.02,  // removing NewParameterImpact\n    };\n\n    let surnameLength = Surname.length; \n    let surnameImpact = 0.00;\n\n    if (surnameLength <= 5) {\n        surnameImpact = -0.3; \n    } else {\n        surnameImpact = 1.3;\n    }\n\n    let linearCombination = (\n        coefficients.CreditScore * CreditScore +\n        coefficients.Age * Age +\n        coefficients.Tenure * Tenure +\n        coefficients.NumOfProducts * NumOfProducts +\n        coefficients.HasCrCard * HasCrCard +\n        coefficients.IsActiveMember * IsActiveMember +\n        coefficients.GeographyImpact * (Geography === 'Germany' ? 0.9 : -0.9) + \n        coefficients.GenderImpact * (Gender === 'Male' ? 2.1 : -1.1) +\n        coefficients.SurnameImpact * surnameImpact\n    );\n\n    const odds = Math.exp(-linearCombination);\n    const probability = 1 / (1 + odds);\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nI have removed the CustomerId impact and the new parameter impact as these were not providing significant contributions to the prediction. I have also adjusted the coefficients and impacts to better reflect their actual influence on the prediction.\n\nPlease feel free to test this updated function with the given input."
