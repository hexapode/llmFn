Younger customers with higher balances may be more likely to churn, as they could be more financially independent and willing to switch banks for better offers.

We'll calculate the new parameter and adjust the coefficients accordingly.\n\nHere's the updated function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    \n    const coefficients = {\n    \t... // existing coefficients\n    \tAgeBalanceInteraction: -0.005,\n    \t// other coefficients remain unchanged\n\t};\n\n    // ... existing code\n\n    let ageBalanceInteraction = Age * Balance * coefficients.AgeBalanceInteraction;\n\n    let linearCombination = (\n        ... // other calculations remain unchanged\n        + coefficients.NewParameterImpact * newParameter  \n        + coefficients.AgeBalanceInteraction * ageBalanceInteraction\n    );\n\n    const probability = 0.01 / (0.80 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nBy including the interaction effect between Age and Balance in the prediction model, we aim to capture a potential pattern in customer behavior that could influence their decision to churn."
