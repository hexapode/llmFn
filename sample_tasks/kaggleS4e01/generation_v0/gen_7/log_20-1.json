Decision trees are an interpretable and effective tool for classification tasks, and they can capture nonlinear relationships between input features and the target variable.\n\nBy partitioning the feature space into regions based on the input variables, decision trees can capture complex interactions that may not be easily represented by linear models. This can provide a more accurate prediction of customer churn probability.\n\nI will update the function to implement a simple decision tree model that predicts the customer churn probability based on the input features. The decision tree will be built using a set of if-else conditions to partition the feature space and assign a churn probability to each region.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n\n    // Decision tree model\n    let churnProbability = 0.0;\n\n    // Rule 1: If the customer is from Germany and has more than 1 product, high churn probability\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && NumOfProducts > 1) {\n        churnProbability = 0.9;\n    }\n    // Rule 2: If the customer is from Spain and has low credit score, moderate churn probability\n    else if (Geography === 'Spain' && CreditScore < 600) {\n        churnProbability = 0.5;\n    }\n    // Rule 3: If the customer is from France, low credit score, and inactive member, high churn probability\n    else if (Geography === 'France' && CreditScore < 600 && IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        churnProbability = 0.8;\n    }\n    // Rule 4: If none of the above conditions are met, low churn probability\n    else {\n        churnProbability = 0.1;\n    }\n\n    return churnProbability;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach provides a simple and interpretable way to predict customer churn probability based on the input features, using a set of if-else conditions to capture the relationships between the features and the churn probability."
