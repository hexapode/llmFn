      "content": "To solve this problem in a novel way, we can use a decision tree approach. Each input parameter will be evaluated at different levels of the tree, leading to a final prediction at the leaves of the tree. This approach makes sense because it allows us to capture complex interactions between the input parameters and make predictions based on these interactions.\n\nHere's the updated function using a decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n  \n    // Decision tree rules\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && (CreditScore < 400 || (Balance > 100000 && Age > 30))) {\n        return 0.9;  // High likelihood of churn\n    } else if (NumOfProducts === 1 && Age < 40 && EstimatedSalary < 100000) {\n        return 0.3;  // Moderate likelihood of churn\n    } else if (IsActiveMember === 0 && (Balance < 50000 || Age > 50)) {\n        return 0.6;  // Moderate likelihood of churn\n    } else {\n        return 0.1;  // Low likelihood of churn\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated solution, we have defined decision tree rules based on the input parameters. The decision tree rules capture specific conditions and interactions between the input parameters to make predictions. Each rule leads to a different likelihood of the customer churning, which is returned as the final prediction."
