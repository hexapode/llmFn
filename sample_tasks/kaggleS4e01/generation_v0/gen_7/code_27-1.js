Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15605872, Surname=Felix, CreditScore=707, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=26.0, Tenure=4, Balance=66573.17, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=62768.8.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    const coefficients = {
        // ... (other coefficients remain unchanged)
        AgeNumOfProductsImpact: 0.03
    };

    // ... (other calculations remain unchanged)

    let ageNumOfProducts = Age * NumOfProducts;
    let ageNumOfProductsImpact = ageNumOfProducts * coefficients.AgeNumOfProductsImpact;

    // ... (other calculations remain unchanged)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing linear combination terms)
        coefficients.AgeNumOfProductsImpact * ageNumOfProductsImpact
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));
