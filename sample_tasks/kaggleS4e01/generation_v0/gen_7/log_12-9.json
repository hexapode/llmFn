This ratio can indicate the financial stability of the customer, and those with higher ratios may be more likely to stay, while those with lower ratios could be more likely to churn. I will update the function to include this new parameter.\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n\n    // ...
