      "content": "To incorporate the CustomerId parameter into the prediction, we can assign a small impact to it in the linear combination. We'll use a simple transformation to convert the large range of CustomerId values into a smaller impact on the prediction. We can achieve this by taking the modulo of the CustomerId and then scaling it to a small range of impact values.\nLet's add the CustomerId parameter to the computation within the `PredictExited` function:\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    \n    const coefficients = {\n    \t// other coefficients remain unchanged\n    \tCustomerIdImpact: 0.007\n\t};\n\n    // Transform the CustomerId into a smaller impact value\n    let customerIdImpact = (CustomerId % 100000) * coefficients.CustomerIdImpact;\n\n    // Other computations remain unchanged\n    \n    let linearCombination = (\n        // previous terms remain unchanged\n        coefficients.CustomerId * CustomerId +\n        // previous terms remain unchanged\n        coefficients.CustomerIdImpact * customerIdImpact\n    );\n\n    const probability = 0.01 / (10.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\nBy incorporating a transformation of the CustomerId into a smaller impact value, we ensure that it contributes to the prediction without overwhelming the other parameters. This allows us to maintain a balanced influence of each parameter on the final prediction."
