Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15781530, Surname=Hsieh, CreditScore=674, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=21.0, Tenure=8, Balance=125470.81, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=174536.17.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (existing code remains the same)

    let ageBalanceImpact = Age * Balance * coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact; // Interaction effect of Age and Balance

    // ... (existing code remains the same)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing terms)
        + ageBalanceImpact // Incorporate the interaction effect
    );

    // ... (existing code remains the same)

    return probability;
}
