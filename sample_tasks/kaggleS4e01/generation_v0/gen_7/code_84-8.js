Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15588701, Surname=Lai, CreditScore=739, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=38.0, Tenure=5, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=35338.96.

    // Use a decision tree algorithm to predict churn
    let prediction = 0;  // Assume the customer stays by default

    // Apply decision tree logic to predict churn
    if (Age <= 30 && NumOfProducts === 1 && Balance > 10000) {
