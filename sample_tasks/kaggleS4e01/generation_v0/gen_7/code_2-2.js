Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15709604, Surname=McMillan, CreditScore=669, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=23.0, Tenure=2, Balance=107433.48, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=173843.21.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Decision tree algorithm implementation
    // ... implement the decision tree logic to predict customer churn

    // Placeholder for the predicted probability
    let predictedProbability = 0.5;

    return predictedProbability;
