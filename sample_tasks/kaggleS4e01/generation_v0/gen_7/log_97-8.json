A decision tree can partition the feature space into regions and assign a probability of churn to each region based on the training data.\n\nWe will use the input parameters to traverse the decision tree and calculate the probability of churn based on the features of the input data.\n\nHere's the updated function to incorporate the decision tree algorithm:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree algorithm\n    if (Geography === 'Germany') {\n        if (NumOfProducts <= 1) {\n            if (Age <= 40) {\n                return 0.72; // High probability of churn\n            } else {\n                return 0.38; // Moderate probability of churn\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (CreditScore <= 700) {\n                return 0.55; // Moderate probability of churn\n            } else {\n                return 0.20; // Low probability of churn\n            }\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === 'Spain') {\n        if (IsActiveMember === 1) {\n            return 0.12; // Low probability of churn\n        } else {\n            if (Balance <= 0) {\n                return 0.58; // High probability of churn\n            } else {\n                return 0.33; // Moderate probability of churn\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        if (CreditScore > 650 && Age < 50) {\n            return 0.25; // Low probability of churn\n        } else {\n            return 0.65; // High probability of churn\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, we have defined a decision tree directly within the function based on the input features. We traverse the tree based on the input values and return the predicted probability of churn. This approach allows us to capture complex relationships between the input features and the churn prediction without relying on predefined coefficients."
