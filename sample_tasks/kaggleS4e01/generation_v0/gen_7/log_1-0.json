DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, one smart way would be to incorporate feature engineering, which involves creating new features from the existing ones that may have a stronger correlation with the customer churn. Additionally, using more advanced machine learning models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the features, providing a better prediction. Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can also help in preventing overfitting and improving the model's generalization ability. Finally, conducting thorough feature selection and hyperparameter tuning could further enhance the model's accuracy."
