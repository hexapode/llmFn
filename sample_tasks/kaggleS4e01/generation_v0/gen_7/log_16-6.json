      "content": "One novel approach to solve the churn prediction problem is by using decision trees. Decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between input features and the churn outcome. By partitioning the feature space into regions and assigning a prediction to each region, decision trees can provide a powerful predictive model.\n\nTo implement this approach, we can use a simple decision tree model to partition the feature space and assign a prediction to each partition. We can then use the input features to traverse the decision tree and reach a prediction for the churn outcome.\n\nHere's the updated function using a simple decision tree model:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n\n    // Decision tree rules\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && NumOfProducts <= 1) {\n        return 1.0; // High churn probability\n    } else if (CreditScore <= 600 && Age > 30) {\n        return 0.9; // High churn probability\n    } else if (Balance > 100000) {\n        return 0.7; // Medium churn probability\n    } else {\n        return 0.1; // Low churn probability\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we use a set of simple decision tree rules based on the input features to predict the churn outcome. Depending on the specific values of the input features, the function returns a probability of the customer churning. This decision tree model captures non-linear relationships between the input features and the churn outcome and provides an alternative approach to predict customer churn."
