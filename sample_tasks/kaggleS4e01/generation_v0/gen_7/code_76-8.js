Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15572398, Surname=Calabrese, CreditScore=706, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=33.0, Tenure=5, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=149665.65.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    let ageTenureRatio = Age / Tenure;

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (other coefficients and parameters remain unchanged)
        coefficients.AgeTenureRatioImpact * ageTenureRatio +
        // ... (rest of the linear combination remains unchanged)
    );

    // ... (probability calculation and return statement remain unchanged)
