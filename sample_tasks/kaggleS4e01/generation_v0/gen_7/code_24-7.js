Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15715140, Surname=Whitehead, CreditScore=624, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=39.0, Tenure=5, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=93336.77.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (existing code remains unchanged)

    let ageBalanceInteraction = Age * (Balance / 10000);  // Interaction between Age and Balance

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing code for linear combination remains unchanged)
        coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact * ageBalanceInteraction  // Include impact of Age-Balance interaction
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
