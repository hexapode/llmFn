Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15757747, Surname=T'ien, CreditScore=581, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=31.0, Tenure=0, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=113557.85.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    const coefficients = {
        // other coefficients remain unchanged
        AgeBalanceImpact: 0.03, // New coefficient for the impact of Age and Balance
    };
    
    // ... (other calculations remain unchanged)

    let ageBalanceImpact = Age * Balance * coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact; // Calculate the impact of Age and Balance

    // ... (other calculations remain unchanged)
    
    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (other terms remain unchanged)
        + surnameValue + ageBalanceImpact + coefficients.CreditScoreImpact * CreditScore 
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination)); // Calculate the final probability

    return probability; // Return the probability of churning
