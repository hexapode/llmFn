Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15806945, Surname=Hs?, CreditScore=637, Geography=Germany, Gender=Female, Age=39.0, Tenure=2, Balance=138014.4, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=140298.24.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Implementation of decision tree to predict customer churn
    // Update the function to construct the decision tree and make the prediction based on the input parameters

    // Decision tree construction and traversal to predict customer churn

    // Return the prediction (probability) at the end of the function
}
