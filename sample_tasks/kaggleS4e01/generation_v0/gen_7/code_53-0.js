Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15576723, Surname=Ts'ai, CreditScore=745, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=37.0, Tenure=7, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=194270.91.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (previous coefficient and parameter calculations)

    // Interaction impact between Age and Tenure
    let ageTenureImpact = (Age * Tenure) * 0.12;

    // Linear combination with the added ageTenureImpact
    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (previous linear combination terms) +
        ageTenureImpact +
        // ... (remaining terms)
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.01 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
