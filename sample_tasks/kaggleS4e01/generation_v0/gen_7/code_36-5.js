Try to think how Gender parameter could impact the prediction, then add a step in the computation using the parameter Gender. Here as some value it can take: Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Female, Male, Male, Male, Female, Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Male, Male, Female, Male.

// After analyzing the impact of the "Gender" parameter on customer churn, let's adjust the computation in the "PredictExited" function to include the gender impact in the linear combination.
