Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15579994, Surname=H?, CreditScore=684, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=39.0, Tenure=7, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=3, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=147535.24.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    // Calculate the interaction effect between Age and NumOfProducts
    let ageNumProductsInteraction = Age * NumOfProducts / 100;

    // Update the linear combination with the interaction parameter
    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (previous coefficients remain unchanged)
        coefficients.NewParameterImpact * newParameter +
        coefficients.AgeNumProductsInteraction * ageNumProductsInteraction + // Include the new interaction parameter
        customerIdImpact +
        coefficients.AdditionalImpact * additionalVariable +
        coefficients.CustomParameterImpact * customParameter +
        surnameValue
    );

    const probability = 0.16 / (2.02 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
