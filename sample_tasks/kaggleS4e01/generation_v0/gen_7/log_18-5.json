DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following smart approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: We can explore additional features or create new features by combining existing features to capture more complex relationships. This can include interaction terms, polynomial features, or derived features from domain knowledge.\n\n2. Model Selection: We can experiment with different models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to see if they capture the patterns in the data better than the linear model.\n\n3. Hyperparameter Tuning: We can optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model to find the best combination that improves accuracy. This can be done using techniques like grid search or random search.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: We can use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, which can help in better understanding the model's generalization ability.\n\n5. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the data is imbalanced, we can explore techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using different evaluation metrics to handle the imbalance and improve prediction accuracy.\n\n6. Regularization: We can apply regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization.\n\n7. Feature Scaling: We can scale the numerical features to a similar range to prevent any feature from dominating the others during the model training.\n\nApplying these smart approaches can help in improving the prediction accuracy of the model."
