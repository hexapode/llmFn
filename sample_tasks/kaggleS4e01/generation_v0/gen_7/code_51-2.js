Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15588080, Surname=Giles, CreditScore=675, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=54.0, Tenure=5, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=110273.84.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (previous function code)

    let newParameter = (Age * Tenure + (HasCrCard === 1.00 ? 1000.00 : 406.15)) / (NumOfProducts + Balance);
    let ageBalanceImpact = (Age * Balance * coefficients.AgeBalanceImpact) * (IsActiveMember === 1.00 ? 2.00 : 1.00); 

    // New parameter based on age and number of products interaction
    let ageNumOfProductsInteraction = Age * NumOfProducts * 0.02;

    // ... (remaining code)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (previous coefficients multiplication)
        + coefficients.AgeNumOfProductsInteraction * ageNumOfProductsInteraction
    );
    
    // ... (remaining code)
}
