Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15627665, Surname=Frolov, CreditScore=662, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=35.0, Tenure=7, Balance=108883.8, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=181489.77.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (coefficients and other calculations remain the same)

    let interactionEffect = (Age * NumOfProducts) / 1000.00;

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (previous linear combination remains the same)
        coefficients.NewParameterImpact * interactionEffect +
        // ... (remaining calculations remain the same)
    );

    const probability = 0.16 / (2.02 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
