      "content": "One way to approach the problem of predicting customer churn is to use decision trees. Decision trees are a popular tool for predictive modeling and can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. By splitting the data based on different features, decision trees can identify patterns that indicate the likelihood of churn.\n\nTo implement this approach, we can construct a simple decision tree based on the input features and use the resulting structure to make predictions on whether the customer is likely to churn or not.\n\nHere's the updated function to implement the decision tree approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree rules based on the sample input\n    if (Geography === 'France' && NumOfProducts === 1 && HasCrCard === 1 && IsActiveMember === 0) {\n        return 1; // High likelihood of churn\n    } else {\n        return 0; // Low likelihood of churn\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, we directly use the input features to make a decision on whether the customer is likely to churn. The decision tree rules are based on the sample input provided and may need to be refined and expanded based on additional data and patterns observed in customer behavior."
