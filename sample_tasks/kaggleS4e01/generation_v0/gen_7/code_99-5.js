Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15634968, Surname=Fomin, CreditScore=751, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=39.0, Tenure=8, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=82298.59.
