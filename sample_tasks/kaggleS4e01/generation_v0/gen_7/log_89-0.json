      "content": "We can incorporate the gender parameter into the computation by assigning a different impact value based on the gender. For example, we could assign a positive impact value if the gender is 'Male' and a negative impact value if the gender is 'Female'. We can then use this impact value in the linear combination calculation to adjust the overall prediction based on the gender.\n\nHere's how we can update the PredictExited function to include the impact of the gender parameter:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    \n    // ... (previous code remains unchanged)\n\n    let genderImpact = (Gender === 'Male' ? 2.44 : -2.36);\n\n    let linearCombination = (\n        // ...

This will allow the function to adjust the prediction based on the gender of the customer."
