Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15761600, Surname=Uwakwe, CreditScore=596, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=52.0, Tenure=6, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=105746.94.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (existing code)

    // New factor: Interaction between Age, Tenure, and IsActiveMember
    let ageTenureImpact = (Age * Tenure * IsActiveMember * 0.02);

    // Update linear combination with the new factor
    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing code)
        + ageTenureImpact
        // ... (existing code)
    );

    // ... (existing code)
}
