function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Implement the decision tree approach for customer churn prediction
    // Calculate the probability of the customer churning based on the decision tree
    
    // ... (Decision tree implementation)
    
    // Return the predicted probability of customer churn
    return 0.75;  // Placeholder value, replace with the actual calculated probability
