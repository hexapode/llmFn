      "content": "One factor that could be influential in the prediction of customer churn is the combination of Age and the number of products the customer owns. Younger customers with a higher number of products might be more inclined to explore other options, leading to a higher churn probability.\nTo implement this, I will create a new parameter called \"AgeProductInteraction\" which will be the product of Age and NumOfProducts. I will then include this new parameter in the linear combination and calculate its impact on the churn probability.\n\nHere's the updated function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n\n    // ... (existing code)\n\n    let ageProductInteraction = Age * NumOfProducts;\n    let ageProductInteractionImpact = ageProductInteraction * 0.03;\n    \n    let linearCombination = (\n        // ...

(existing calculations)\n    );\n\n    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));\n\n    return probability;\n}\n```\n\nAdding the \"AgeProductInteraction\" factor will allow the function to capture the potential influence of Age and NumOfProducts on the churn probability. The impact of this new factor is set to 0.03 based on the observation of historical data or any domain expertise that suggests its significance."
