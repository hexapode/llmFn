DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Explore the possibility of creating new features or combining existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns in the data. For example, you could create interaction terms, polynomial features, or use domain knowledge to derive new meaningful features.\n\n2. Model Selection: Consider using more advanced models such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or even neural networks if they are allowed. These models might be able to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features better than a simple linear model.\n\n3. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of the model and ensure that it generalizes well to new data. This can help in identifying overfitting and tuning the model hyperparameters effectively.\n\n4. Regularization: Regularization techniques such as L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization can help in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization of the model.\n\n5. Feature Selection: Perform feature selection to identify the most important features and eliminate irrelevant or redundant ones. This can help in reducing noise and improving the model's performance.\n\n6. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced, consider techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using synthetic data generation methods to balance the classes and improve model performance.\n\n7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search, random search, or specialized optimization algorithms to find the best combination of hyperparameters for improved performance.\n\nBy incorporating these smart ways, you can potentially enhance the prediction accuracy of the model."
