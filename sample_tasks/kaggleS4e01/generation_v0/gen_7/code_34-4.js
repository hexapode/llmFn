Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15687519, Surname=Calabresi, CreditScore=621, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=41.0, Tenure=4, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=99398.36.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (existing code)

    let tenureImpact = 0.20; // Coefficient for tenure parameter

    let ageTenureInteraction = Age * Tenure * 0.03; // Interaction between Age and Tenure

    // ... (existing code)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing calculation)
