DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function.

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, we can consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: We can create new features by combining existing features or extracting more meaningful information from them. For example, creating interaction terms (e.g., Age * Balance), deriving ratios (e.g., Age / EstimatedSalary), or encoding categorical variables in a more informative way.\n\n2. Model Selection: We can explore different models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines to see if a more complex model can better capture the patterns in the data.\n\n3. Cross-Validation: We can use cross-validation techniques to validate the model's performance and ensure that it generalizes well to new data.\n\n4. Regularization: We can apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: We can search for the best combination of model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize the model's performance.\n\n6. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced with respect to the churn label, we can use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE to balance the classes and improve the model's ability to predict churn accurately.\n\nBy implementing these smart ways, we can enhance the prediction accuracy of the model and provide more reliable churn predictions for the customers."
