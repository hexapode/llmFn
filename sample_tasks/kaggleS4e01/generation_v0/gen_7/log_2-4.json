DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictExited  and its signature should be PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\nBefore updating the function explain your reasoning in a comment.\nCompute your prediction in the function, and return them at the end of the function. Do not return value before end of function.\nThe function should not contain calls to a neural network or machine learning model.\n"

Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing data that might provide better insight into the problem. Feature selection helps to identify the most relevant features that have the most impact on the prediction. Model optimization involves tuning the parameters of the model to improve its performance. Additionally, using more complex models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting could also improve prediction accuracy. However, as per the given constraints, we are limited to using a simple linear model and cannot use more complex techniques. If the constraints were relaxed, using a more advanced model could be a potential way to improve prediction accuracy."
