Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15798888, Surname=Ozoemena, CreditScore=599, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=28.0, Tenure=9, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=187921.3.

    // Placeholder for decision tree prediction
    const predictedChurnProbability = decisionTreePredict(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary);
