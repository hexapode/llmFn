Since decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data, they can be a good fit for this prediction task.\n\nI will split the data based on certain features and their thresholds to classify whether the customer will churn or stay. I will calculate the probability of churning based on the proportion of churned customers in each leaf node of the decision tree.\n\nLet's update the function to implement this approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Decision tree thresholds\n    const ageThreshold = 40;\n    const creditScoreThreshold = 600;\n    const balanceThreshold = 10000;\n    const tenureThreshold = 5;\n    \n    let probability = 0;\n    \n    // Decision tree\n    if (Age <= ageThreshold) {\n        if (CreditScore <= creditScoreThreshold) {\n            probability = 0.8; // High probability of churn\n        } else {\n            if (Balance > balanceThreshold) {\n                probability = 0.4; // Medium probability of churn\n            } else {\n                probability = 0.1; // Low probability of churn\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        if (Tenure <= tenureThreshold) {\n            probability = 0.6; // Medium probability of churn\n        } else {\n            probability = 0.2; // Low probability of churn\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return probability;\n}\n```\nIn this approach, I have used simple if-else conditions to split the data based on certain thresholds of features like Age, CreditScore, Balance, and Tenure. I then assigned a probability of churning based on these splits. This approach allows us to capture non-linear relationships between the input parameters and the likelihood of churning."
