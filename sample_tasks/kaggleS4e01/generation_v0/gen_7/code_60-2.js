Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15740411, Surname=Molle, CreditScore=704, Geography=Germany, Gender=Male, Age=30.0, Tenure=7, Balance=141787.31, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=109685.61.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    const coefficients = {
        // ... (previous coefficients)
        TenureImpact: -0.04, // Impact of tenure on churn prediction
        // ... (other coefficients)
    };

    // ... (previous calculations)

    // Calculate the impact of tenure on churn prediction
    let tenureImpact = coefficients.TenureImpact * Tenure;

    // Update the linear combination with the impact of tenure
