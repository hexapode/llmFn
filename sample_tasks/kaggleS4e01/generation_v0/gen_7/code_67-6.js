Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15724076, Surname=Christie, CreditScore=718, Geography=Spain, Gender=Male, Age=52.0, Tenure=3, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=3, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=38941.44.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (previous coefficients and calculations)

    let ageGenderProductInteraction = Age * (NumOfProducts / 2) * (Gender === 'Male' ? 0.05 : -0.05);

    // ... (remaining calculations)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (previous linear combination terms)
        // add the ageGenderProductInteraction to the linear combination
        ageGenderProductInteraction
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
