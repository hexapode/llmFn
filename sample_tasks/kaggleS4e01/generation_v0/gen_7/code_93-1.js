Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 1 for: CustomerId=15723721, Surname=Tinline, CreditScore=543, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=30.0, Tenure=3, Balance=140916.81, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=157711.18.

    // Decision tree feature importance and probability calculation

    // Decision tree feature importance calculation using the given input parameters
    let feature1 = CreditScore > 600 ? 1 : 0; // Example split based on CreditScore
    let feature2 = Age > 25 ? 1 : 0; // Example split based on Age
    let feature3 = Geography === 'France' ? 1 : 0; // Example split based on Geography
    let feature4 = IsActiveMember === 1.0 ? 1 : 0; // Example split based on IsActiveMember

    // Calculate feature importance scores
    let feature1Weight = 0.2;
    let feature2Weight = 0.3;
    let feature3Weight = 0.1;
    let feature4Weight = 0.4;

    // Calculate churn probability based on feature importance
    let churnProbability = (feature1 * feature1Weight + feature2 * feature2Weight + feature3 * feature3Weight + feature4 * feature4Weight) / (feature1Weight + feature2Weight + feature3Weight + feature4Weight);

    return churnProbability;  // Return churn probability
}
