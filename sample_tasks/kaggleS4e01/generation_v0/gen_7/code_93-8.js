Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15651958, Surname=Giles, CreditScore=756, Geography=Spain, Gender=Female, Age=46.0, Tenure=8, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=157932.75.
**/

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // ... (existing code)

    let ageProductInteraction = Age * NumOfProducts;
    let ageProductInteractionImpact = ageProductInteraction * 0.03;
    
    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (existing calculations)
        + coefficients.NewParameterImpact * newParameter
        + coefficients.AgeProductInteractionImpact * ageProductInteraction
        // ... (existing calculations)
    );

    const probability = 1.00 / (1.00 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
}
