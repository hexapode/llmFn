Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15789432, Surname=Mazzanti, CreditScore=451, Geography=France, Gender=Male, Age=33.0, Tenure=6, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=184954.11.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    // Decision tree algorithm
    let probability = 0.00;

    // Logic for decision tree algorithm based on input features
    // ...

    // Compute the probability of churn based on decision tree algorithm
