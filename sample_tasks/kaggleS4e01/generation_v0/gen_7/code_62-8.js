Try to think outside the box, and find novel a way to solve the problem. First describe it and why you think it make sense, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15797772, Surname=Mazzanti, CreditScore=826, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=29.0, Tenure=7, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=137772.23.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {
    // Decision tree rules and leaf node class distribution
    // ... (code for decision tree implementation)

    // Traverse decision tree based on input parameters

    // Compute churn probability using the class distribution in the leaf node

    return churnProbability;
