      "content": "Including the Surname parameter in the prediction can be challenging, as it is not a numerical value and does not have a straightforward linear relationship with the customer churn. However, we can attempt to encode the Surname parameter into a numerical representation by applying some encoding technique, like one-hot encoding. This will create dummy variables for each different Surname value, which can then be used as inputs for the prediction model. \n\nHowever, considering the limitations of this encoding technique, if we assume that certain Surnames could be associated with certain demographics or cultural backgrounds, we can indirectly include this information in our prediction model. For example, if certain Surnames are more common in specific regions, we can use the Geography parameter as a proxy for the cultural impact of Surnames. \n\nIn this function, we can add a step that incorporates the indirect impact of Surname through the Geography parameter. We can incorporate different weights for Surnames within the same Geography, assuming that customers with similar Surnames within the same geographical area may have similar behaviors. \n\nHere's an updated version of the function that takes into account the Geography parameter to indirectly address the impact of Surname:\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // ... other code ...\n    \n    let surnameImpact = 0;\n    if (Geography === \"Asia\") {\n        if (Surname === \"Hsueh\" || Surname === \"Kao\" || Surname === \"Ch'ang\" || Surname === \"Tung\") {\n            surnameImpact = 0.1;\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === \"Europe\") {\n        if (Surname === \"Genovese\" || Surname === \"Cattaneo\" || Surname === \"Rossi\" || Surname === \"Fokine\") {\n            surnameImpact = 0.15;\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === \"Africa\") {\n        if (Surname === \"Okwudilichukwu\" || Surname === \"Okwudiliolisa\" || Surname === \"Chiemenam\" || Surname === \"Chukwuebuka\" || Surname === \"Chukwuemeka\") {\n            surnameImpact = 0.2;\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === \"North America\") {\n        if (Surname === \"Macdonald\" || Surname === \"Esquivel\" || Surname === \"Hargreaves\") {\n            surnameImpact = 0.1;\n        }\n    } else if (Geography === \"South America\") {\n        if (Surname === \"Manna\") {\n            surnameImpact = 0.05;\n        }\n    }\n\n    const linearCombination = weightCustomerId * CustomerId + weightCreditScore * CreditScore + weightAge * Age + weightTenure * Tenure + weightBalance * Balance + weightNumOfProducts * NumOfProducts + weightHasCrCard * HasCrCard + weightIsActiveMember * IsActiveMember + weightEstimatedSalary * EstimatedSalary + surnameImpact;\n    \n    const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));\n    \n    return probability;\n}\n```"
