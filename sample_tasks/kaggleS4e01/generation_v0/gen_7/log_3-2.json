      "content": "One unique way to solve the problem is by using a decision tree model. A decision tree model can help capture complex interactions between different features and make predictions based on the structure of the tree.\n\nIn the context of customer churn prediction, a decision tree model can consider the non-linear relationships between different features such as age, balance, credit score, geography, etc., and predict the likelihood of customer churn based on the learned decision rules.\n\nHowever, since we are not allowed to use machine learning models, we can still implement a simplified version of a decision tree by manually defining decision rules based on the input features.\n\nLet's manually define decision rules to predict customer churn based on the input parameters. We will consider the interactions between features and define decision thresholds to make predictions.\n\nHere's how the updated function would look like:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {\n    // Manually define decision rules based on input features\n    if (Geography === 'Germany' && NumOfProducts > 1) {\n        return 0.8;  // Higher likelihood of churn\n    } else if (Age > 30 && Balance < 10000) {\n        return 0.4;  // Moderate likelihood of churn\n    } else {\n        return 0.1;  // Low likelihood of churn\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, we use specific conditions based on the input features to determine the likelihood of customer churn. The decision rules are manually defined and capture the interactions between different features to make predictions."
