Try to add to think which input parameter will make sense as an extra factor in one of the existing line of the computation, add it to the line(s) in a way that make sense. here is a sample input:

    // ... (previous code remains the same) ...

    let extraFactor = NumOfProducts * (HasCrCard === 0 ? 0.5 : 1.0);  // Adding NumOfProducts and HasCrCard as an extra factor
