Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15779904, Surname=Yevseyev, CreditScore=576, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=41.0, Tenure=2, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=2, HasCrCard=0.0, IsActiveMember=0.0, EstimatedSalary=136079.64.

function PredictExited(CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary) {

    const coefficients = {
        // ... (previously defined coefficients)
        TenureImpact: -0.06,
        // ... (previously defined coefficients)
    };

    // ... (previously defined calculations)

    let linearCombination = (
        // ... (previously defined linear combination with additional factor included)
        coefficients.Tenure * Tenure +
        // ... (previously defined linear combination with additional factor included)

    const probability = 0.16 / (2.02 + Math.exp(-linearCombination));

    return probability;
