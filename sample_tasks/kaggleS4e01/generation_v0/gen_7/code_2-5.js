Try to think of a factor that could make sense for this prediction. How could it be infer / predicted based on the input parameter available to the function, then update the function to implement it. here is a sample input for reference, so you can look at available parameters:
The result is 0 for: CustomerId=15768201, Surname=Ch'in, CreditScore=587, Geography=France, Gender=Female, Age=34.0, Tenure=4, Balance=0.0, NumOfProducts=1, HasCrCard=1.0, IsActiveMember=1.0, EstimatedSalary=598.4.
