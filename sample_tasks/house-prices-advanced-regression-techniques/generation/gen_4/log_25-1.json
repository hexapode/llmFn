      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart strategies:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing ones to capture more complex relationships between the input characteristics and the house price.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to prevent them from skewing the predictions.\n\n3. Normalization and Scaling: Scale the input features to a similar range or apply normalization techniques to ensure that all features contribute equally to the prediction.\n\n4. Advanced Algorithms: Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms such as ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) or neural networks to capture non-linear relationships in the data.\n\n5. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data, ensuring that the predictions are robust and generalizable.\n\n6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the predictive model to optimize its performance and reduce overfitting.\n\n7. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can enhance the accuracy of the house price prediction model."
