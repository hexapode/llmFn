      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. These algorithms can help in finding complex patterns and relationships between the input characteristics and the house prices. You will need to train the model using a dataset of house characteristics and their corresponding sale prices. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the house price based on the input characteristics with higher accuracy. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection are also key aspects to consider when aiming to improve prediction accuracy."
