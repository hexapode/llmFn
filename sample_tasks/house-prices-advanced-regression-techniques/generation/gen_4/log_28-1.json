      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart strategies:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing dataset that could provide more information and insights for the prediction model. For example, creating a feature that combines the total square footage of the house could be more informative than considering individual square footage features.\n\n2. Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to reduce their impact on the prediction model. Outliers can significantly affect the accuracy of the model, so it's important to detect and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the input features to ensure that they are on a similar scale. Normalization helps in improving the convergence speed of the model and can lead to better prediction accuracy.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model and tune the hyperparameters effectively. Cross-validation helps in detecting overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n5. Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or AdaBoost to combine multiple models for improved prediction accuracy. Ensemble methods tend to perform better than individual models in many cases.\n\n6. Regularization Techniques: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capability of the model.\n\n7. Handling Missing Values: Deal with missing values in the dataset by imputation or using advanced techniques such as predictive imputation or imputing missing values based on similar instances.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can significantly enhance the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
