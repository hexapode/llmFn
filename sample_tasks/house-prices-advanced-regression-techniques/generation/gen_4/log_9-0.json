      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider the following strategies:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing ones, such as calculating the total area of the house or creating interaction terms between different variables.\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that could be affecting the prediction accuracy.\n3. Data Preprocessing: Standardize or normalize the numerical features, handle missing values appropriately, and encode categorical variables effectively.\n4. Regularization: Use regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n5. Model Selection: Experiment with different regression models such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, or gradient boosting regression to find the best model for the dataset.\n6. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and ensure its robustness.\n7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Search for the optimal hyperparameters of the chosen model through techniques like grid search or random search.\n8. Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble methods like stacking or bagging to combine the predictions of multiple models and enhance accuracy.\nBy implementing these strategies, you can refine the model and potentially achieve a higher prediction accuracy for the house prices."
