      "content": "One smart way to improve the prediction accuracy of the house price is to use feature engineering. This involves creating new features or transforming existing features that can better capture the relationships between the input characteristics and the sales price. For example, you can create a new feature by combining the total number of bathrooms in the house (full bathrooms + half bathrooms) or by calculating the age of the house at the time of sale (YrSold - YearBuilt).\n\nAdditionally, you can apply techniques such as outlier detection and removal to eliminate noisy data points that could negatively impact the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, you can consider using advanced machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting or neural networks, but note that these would require a significantly more complex implementation compared to a basic javascript function.\n\nLastly, you can also utilize cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's prediction accuracy is reliable across different subsets of the data, and to guard against overfitting."
