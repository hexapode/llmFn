Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that might have a stronger correlation with the sales price.\n\n2. Outlier Detection and Removal: Identify and remove outliers in the dataset that might be affecting the predictions.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize numerical features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the prediction.\n\n4. Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining important information.\n\n5. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as L1 or L2 regularization.\n\n6. Cross-Validation: Optimize the model hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's generalization.\n\n7. Advanced Regression Techniques: Use advanced regression techniques such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, or Elastic Net Regression to handle multicollinearity and improve model performance.\n\nImplementing these smart ways can contribute to improving the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
