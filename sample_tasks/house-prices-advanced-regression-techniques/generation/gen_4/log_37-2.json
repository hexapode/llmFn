      "content": "One way to improve the prediction accuracy is to use feature scaling and normalization techniques to ensure that all input features are on a similar scale. This can help the model converge faster and provide more accurate predictions.\n\nAnother approach could be to use feature engineering to create new features that may have a stronger correlation with the target variable. This could involve creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or deriving new features from the existing ones.\n\nAdditionally, training the model using a more complex algorithm such as a Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, or Neural Network could potentially lead to better prediction accuracy compared to simpler models.\n\nEnsembling techniques, where predictions from multiple models are combined, can also be employed to improve accuracy. This could involve techniques such as stacking, bagging, or boosting.\n\nFinally, performing thorough data cleaning and handling missing values appropriately can significantly improve the performance of the predictive model."
