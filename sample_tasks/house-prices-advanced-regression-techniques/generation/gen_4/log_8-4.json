      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that could provide more meaningful information to the model. For example, you could combine the total square footage of the basement, first floor, and second floor to create a new feature representing the total living area.\n\n2. Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and handle any outliers in the dataset that could negatively impact the prediction accuracy. Consider using statistical methods such as Z-score or IQR to detect and remove outliers.\n\n3. Normalization and Scaling: Normalize or scale the input features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training. This can be particularly useful for distance-based algorithms or models like Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n\n4. Feature Selection: Identify the most important features that contribute significantly to the prediction of house prices. You can use techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance scores from tree-based models, or model-based feature selection methods.\n\n5. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance and generalization ability. This can help in choosing the best model and tuning hyperparameters effectively.\n\n6. Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, which combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can potentially enhance the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
