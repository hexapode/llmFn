      "content": "One way to improve the prediction accuracy for house prices is to use feature engineering to create new features from the existing data. This could involve combining or transforming the existing features to uncover new patterns and relationships that could better predict the house prices.\n\nAdditionally, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques such as regression models, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks might also improve prediction accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, performing thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize the data could lead to better results. Additionally, regularization techniques and cross-validation can help to avoid overfitting and improve the model's generalization.\n\nFinally, analyzing and including external data sources such as neighborhood demographics, proximity to amenities, or market trends could also enhance the predictive power of the model."
