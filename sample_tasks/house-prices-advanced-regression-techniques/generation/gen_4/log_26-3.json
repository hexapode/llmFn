      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider implementing the following smart techniques:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that might have a stronger correlation with the sales price.\n2. Outlier Detection and Removal: Identify and remove any outliers in the dataset that might be affecting the prediction accuracy.\n3. Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of input features while preserving important information.\n4. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n5. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to combine the predictions from multiple models, which often leads to better accuracy.\n6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize the model performance.\nImplementing any of these techniques or a combination of them could potentially lead to a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy."
