      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data that might have a stronger correlation with the sales price. For example, you can create a new feature by combining the total square footage of the house, or by creating a feature that represents the overall quality of both the exterior and interior.\n\n2. Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and handle outliers in the data that might be negatively impacting the prediction accuracy.\n\n3. Handling Missing Values: Implement a smart approach to handle missing values in the dataset. This might involve imputation techniques, such as using the mean or median values for numerical features or using the mode for categorical features.\n\n4. Normalization and Standardization: Scale the numerical features to a similar range using normalization or standardization techniques, which can improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.\n\n5. Feature Selection: Use techniques like Lasso regression, Random Forest Feature Importance, or Recursive Feature Elimination to select the most important features for predicting the sales price.\n\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.\n\n7. Advanced Machine Learning Models: Experiment with more complex machine learning models such as Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost, or Neural Networks, which might capture non-linear relationships in the data more effectively.\n\nBy incorporating these smart approaches, you can potentially improve the accuracy of the house price prediction model."
