This type of regression model can take into account multiple input features such as the overall quality, year built, total basement square feet, living area square feet, number of full bathrooms, number of cars in the garage, garage area, and year of remodeling. These features are likely to have an impact on the sales price of a house, and a multiple linear regression model can capture the relationship between these features and the sales price.\n\nHere's the implementation of the predictHousePrice function using a multiple linear regression model:\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictHousePrice(OverallQual, YearBuilt, TotalBsmtSF, GrLivArea, FullBath, GarageCars, GarageArea, YearRemodAdd) {\n  // Coefficients of the regression model\n  const coefOverallQual = 20000;\n  const coefYearBuilt = 500;\n  const coefTotalBsmtSF = 50;\n  const coefGrLivArea = 100;\n  const coefFullBath = 5000;\n  const coefGarageCars = 8000;\n  const coefGarageArea = 50;\n  const coefYearRemodAdd = 300;\n\n  // Intercept of the regression model\n  const intercept = 50000;\n\n  // Calculate the predicted sales price using the multiple linear regression model\n  const predictedPrice = intercept + (coefOverallQual * OverallQual) + (coefYearBuilt * (2022 - YearBuilt))\n    + (coefTotalBsmtSF * TotalBsmtSF) + (coefGrLivArea * GrLivArea) + (coefFullBath * FullBath)\n    + (coefGarageCars * GarageCars) + (coefGarageArea * GarageArea) + (coefYearRemodAdd * (2022 - YearRemodAdd));\n\n  return predictedPrice;\n}\n```"
