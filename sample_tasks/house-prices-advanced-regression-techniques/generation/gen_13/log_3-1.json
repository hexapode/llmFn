      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider using techniques such as feature engineering, regularization, and model selection. Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to better represent the underlying problem and to improve the predictive power of the model. Regularization techniques such as Lasso or Ridge regression can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. Model selection involves trying different algorithms and selecting the one that best fits the data. Additionally, you can consider using more advanced machine learning techniques such as random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks to capture complex non-linear relationships in the data. Lastly, cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning can also be used to fine-tune the model and improve its predictive performance."
