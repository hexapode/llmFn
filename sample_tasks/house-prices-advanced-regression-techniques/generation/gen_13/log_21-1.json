      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider using advanced techniques such as feature engineering, data normalization, regularization, and possibly even machine learning algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks.\n\nFeature Engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing ones to capture more information about the house characteristics. For example, you could create a feature that combines the total number of bathrooms (FullBath, HalfBath, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath) or a feature that combines the square footage of different parts of the house.\n\nData Normalization: Scaling the input features to a similar range can help the model converge faster and provide better predictions. For example, you could normalize the LotArea, TotalBsmtSF, and GrLivArea features to a similar range.\n\nRegularization: This technique can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty for large coefficient values. Ridge regression and Lasso regression are commonly used regularization techniques.\n\nMachine Learning Algorithms: Consider using machine learning algorithms to train a model on historical house price data. This can help capture complex patterns and relationships between the input features and the sales price.\n\nCross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model on different subsets of the data. This can help ensure that the model's performance is consistent and reliable.\n\nIt's important to note that implementing these techniques will require more complex code and possibly the use of external libraries. In this exercise, we are limited to using basic calculations within the predictHousePrice function."
