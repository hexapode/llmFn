Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing ones to provide more information to the model. Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can help in reducing overfitting. Model selection involves trying out different models and selecting the one that performs best for the given data. Ensemble methods such as random forest or gradient boosting can combine multiple models to make more accurate predictions. Additionally, you could also consider normalizing or scaling the input features and handling missing data appropriately to improve the accuracy of the predictions."
