      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider the following steps:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new meaningful features based on the existing features. For example, you could create a new feature by combining the total number of bathrooms (FullBath, HalfBath, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath) to capture the overall bathroom space in the house.\n\n2. Outlier Detection and Removal: Identify and remove outliers from the dataset that could negatively impact the prediction accuracy.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the numerical features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the prediction.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to validate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, which can help in identifying potential overfitting or underfitting issues.\n\n5. Use Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to combine the predictions of multiple models, which can often lead to better prediction accuracy.\n\n6. Fine-tune Model Parameters: Experiment with different model parameters and hyperparameters to find the optimal settings for your predictive model.\n\n7. Regularization Techniques: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.\n\nBy implementing these steps, you can improve the prediction accuracy and create a more robust model for predicting house prices."
