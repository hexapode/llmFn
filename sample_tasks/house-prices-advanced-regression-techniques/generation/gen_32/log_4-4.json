In this case, we can use a rule-based system that leverages expert knowledge and domain-specific heuristics to predict house prices.\n\nOne approach could involve creating a set of rules that assign weights to different features of the house. For example, the number of bedrooms, condition of the house, and the quality of the kitchen, among other factors, could be weighted and summed to provide a predicted sales price.\n\nHere's how this might look when implemented in the predictHousePrice function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictHousePrice(Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2, BldgType, HouseStyle, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, RoofStyle, RoofMatl, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, ExterQual, ExterCond, Foundation, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinType2, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, Heating, HeatingQC, CentralAir, Electrical, _1stFlrSF, _2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenAbvGr, KitchenQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, Functional, Fireplaces, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageCars, GarageArea, GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, _3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, MiscVal, MoSold, YrSold, SaleType, SaleCondition) {\n  let price = 180000; // Starting price\n\n  // Sample rule-based calculations\n  if (OverallQual >= 8) {\n    price += 20000;\n  }\n  \n  if (GrLivArea > 3000) {\n    price += 15000;\n  }\n\n  // More rule-based calculations based on domain-specific heuristics\n\n  return price;\n}\n```"

A decision tree can capture non-linear relationships between the input features and the output (in this case, the house price) and can handle categorical and numerical data effectively.\n\nThe decision tree can be trained on historical house price data to learn how different combinations of house characteristics affect the price.
