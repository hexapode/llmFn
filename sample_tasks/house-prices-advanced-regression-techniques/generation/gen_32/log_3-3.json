      "content": "To tackle the house price prediction problem without a machine learning model, we can leverage a rule-based approach and assign weights to each house characteristic based on its importance in determining the sales price. We can then calculate a weighted sum of these characteristics to estimate the house price.\n\nOne way to assign weights is through expert knowledge or statistical analysis of historical sales data. For example, characteristics such as the overall quality, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the year built could carry more weight in influencing the house price.\n\nUsing this approach, we can create a formula that incorporates the weighted characteristics to make the sales price prediction.\n\nHere is an example of implementing this method in the predictHousePrice function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictHousePrice(Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2, BldgType, HouseStyle, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, RoofStyle, RoofMatl, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, ExterQual, ExterCond, Foundation, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinType2, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, Heating, HeatingQC, CentralAir, Electrical, _1stFlrSF, _2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenAbvGr, KitchenQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, Functional, Fireplaces, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageCars, GarageArea, GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, _3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, MiscVal, MoSold, YrSold, SaleType, SaleCondition) {\n  // Define weights for each characteristic (These weights can be estimated based on expert knowledge or historical data analysis)\n  const weights = {\n    OverallQual: 10000,\n    OverallCond: -5000,\n    YearBuilt: 500,\n    YearRemodAdd: 200,\n    GrLivArea: 100,\n    TotalBsmtSF: 80,\n    GarageCars: 5000,\n    GarageArea: 50,\n    // ...
