      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, a smart way would be to train a machine learning model using historical house sale data. By using regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression, the model can learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the actual sale prices. This trained model can then be used to predict the sale price of a new house based on its characteristics with much higher accuracy than a simple calculation.\n\nOnce the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions for new houses by inputting the characteristics of the house into the model and obtaining the predicted sale price. Using machine learning for prediction will allow for a more sophisticated and accurate method compared to a simple calculation."
