      "content": "One way to solve this problem is to use a machine learning regression model, such as linear regression, to predict the house price based on the input characteristics. By training the model with a dataset of historical house sales and their corresponding characteristics, the model can learn the relationship between the input features and the sales price, and then make predictions for new houses based on their characteristics.\n\nImplementing this approach in the function predictHousePrice would involve loading a pre-trained regression model, preprocessing the input data to match the format expected by the model, and then using the model to make a prediction. However, building and training a machine learning model is beyond the scope of a simple function implementation.\n\nGiven that constraint, an alternative approach is to use a rule-based system where we assign weights to different input features based on domain knowledge or heuristics. We can then combine these weighted features to obtain the predicted house price.\n\nHere's how we can implement this approach in the function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictHousePrice(Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2, BldgType, HouseStyle, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, RoofStyle, RoofMatl, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, ExterQual, ExterCond, Foundation, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinType2, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, Heating, HeatingQC, CentralAir, Electrical, _1stFlrSF, _2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenAbvGr, KitchenQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, Functional, Fireplaces, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageCars, GarageArea, GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, _3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, MiscVal, MoSold, YrSold, SaleType, SaleCondition) {\n    let predictedPrice = 180000; // Base price\n\n    // Feature weights (heuristic)\n    let areaWeight = 100; // Weight for LotArea\n    let conditionWeight = 5000; // Weight for OverallCond\n    let yearWeight = 2000; // Weight for YearBuilt\n\n    // Combine features with weights\n    predictedPrice += LotArea * areaWeight;\n    predictedPrice += OverallCond * conditionWeight;\n    predictedPrice += (2022 - YearBuilt) * yearWeight;\n\n    return predictedPrice;\n}\n```"
