We can use the input characteristics of a house as features and the sales price as the target variable for the training dataset. By training a regression model on a large dataset of housing information, the model can learn the relationships between the features and the sales price, allowing us to make predictions on new input data.\n\nHere's how we can implement this approach in the predictHousePrice function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictHousePrice(Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2, BldgType, HouseStyle, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, RoofStyle, RoofMatl, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, ExterQual, ExterCond, Foundation, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinType2, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, Heating, HeatingQC, CentralAir, Electrical, _1stFlrSF, _2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenAbvGr, KitchenQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, Functional, Fireplaces, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageCars, GarageArea, GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, _3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, MiscVal, MoSold, YrSold, SaleType, SaleCondition) {\n    // In this function, we can use a trained regression model to predict the sales price based on the input characteristics of the house\n    // We would load the trained model and use it to make predictions on the input features\n    // This involves applying the learned coefficients of the model to the input features and summing them up to get the predicted price\n\n    // Placeholder value for predictedPrice, actual prediction would involve using the trained regression model\n    let predictedPrice = 180000; \n    return predictedPrice;\n}\n```"
