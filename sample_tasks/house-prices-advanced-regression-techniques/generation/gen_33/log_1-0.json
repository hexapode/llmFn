      "content": "One way to improve the prediction accuracy could be to use feature scaling and normalization techniques on the input data. This would involve scaling the input parameters to a similar range, which can help prevent certain features from having a disproportionate impact on the prediction.\n\nAdditionally, using techniques like feature engineering to create new meaningful features from the existing ones can improve the accuracy of the predictions. This could involve combining or transforming existing features to create new ones that may have a more significant impact on the predicted house price.\n\nAnother approach could be to use a machine learning algorithm, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to train a model based on historical housing data. This model could then be used to make predictions based on the input characteristics provided.\n\nLastly, gathering a more comprehensive dataset with a larger number of features and samples could improve the accuracy of the predictions by providing a richer set of inputs for the model to learn from."
