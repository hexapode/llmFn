DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named predictHousePrice  and its signature should be predictHousePrice(Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2, BldgType, HouseStyle, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, RoofStyle, RoofMatl, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, ExterQual, ExterCond, Foundation, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinType2, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, Heating, HeatingQC, CentralAir, Electrical, _1stFlrSF, _2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenAbvGr, KitchenQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, Functional, Fireplaces, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageCars, GarageArea, GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, _3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, MiscVal, MoSold, YrSold, SaleType, SaleCondition).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\n"
