      "content": "One effective way to improve the prediction accuracy is to use a machine learning algorithm, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to train a model based on a dataset of house characteristics and their corresponding sales prices.\n\nYou can use the dataset to train the model, and then validate the model using techniques such as cross-validation or splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering can help improve the accuracy. This involves selecting and transforming the input features to create new features that better capture the relationship between the input characteristics and the sales price.\n\nIncorporating more relevant features and using techniques like regularization to prevent overfitting can also contribute to better accuracy. Finally, ensembling multiple models together can help improve prediction accuracy by combining the strengths of individual models."
