      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, one smart way could be to use feature scaling and normalization. By normalizing the input features, we can bring all of them to a similar scale, which can help the model converge faster and potentially improve the prediction accuracy. Additionally, using advanced machine learning techniques such as regression analysis, decision trees, or neural networks could also improve the accuracy of the prediction. Finally, feature engineering, where we create new features from the existing ones, could also improve the predictive power of the model."
