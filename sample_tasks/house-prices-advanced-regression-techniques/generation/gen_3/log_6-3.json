Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data that might have a stronger correlation with the sales price.\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to avoid skewed predictions.\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the input data to ensure that all features contribute equally to the prediction.\n4. Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.\n5. Ensemble Methods: Implement ensemble methods such as random forests or gradient boosting to combine the predictions of multiple models for better accuracy.\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization to new data.\n7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust the model's hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration for better performance.\n8. Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features and remove irrelevant ones to improve the model's accuracy and efficiency.\nBy incorporating these techniques into the prediction model, you can potentially improve the accuracy of the house price predictions."
