      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following techniques:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones, derive meaningful features that might have a stronger correlation with the house price.\n\n2. Data Preprocessing: Normalize or standardize the input data to remove any variations in the scales of different features.\n\n3. Feature Selection: Use techniques like Lasso Regression, Random Forest Importance, or Recursive Feature Elimination to select the most relevant features for the prediction model.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and tune hyperparameters to avoid overfitting.\n\n5. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost to combine multiple models for improved prediction accuracy.\n\n6. Non-linear Models: Consider using non-linear models like Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, or Kernel methods to capture complex patterns in the data.\n\n7. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization of the model.\n\nImplementing these techniques will help in building a more accurate prediction model for house prices."
