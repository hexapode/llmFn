      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing features that provide more relevant information for predicting house prices. For example, you can create a new feature by combining the total square footage of the house, or by categorizing the neighborhood based on property values.\n\n2. Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset which may be impacting the prediction accuracy. You can use statistical methods such as Z-score or IQR, or machine learning algorithms to detect and handle outliers.\n\n3. Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the input features while retaining important information. This can help in reducing noise and focusing on the most significant components affecting the house prices.\n\n4. Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to validate the model's performance and ensure that the predicted prices are robust and not biased towards the training dataset.\n\n5. Regularization and Tuning Hyperparameters: Implement regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting. Additionally, fine-tune the hyperparameters of the prediction model using techniques such as grid search or random search.\n\n6. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Stacking to combine the predictions from multiple models, and improve the overall prediction accuracy.\n\nBy incorporating these smart approaches, you can enhance the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
