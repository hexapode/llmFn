      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart approaches:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing features based on domain knowledge or data analysis. For example, you can create a new feature by combining the total square footage of the house or adding a feature that represents the overall quality and condition of the exterior and interior.\n\n2. Data Preprocessing: Normalize or scale the input features to ensure that the model can learn the patterns effectively. Handling missing values, outlier detection and removal, and encoding categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding can also improve the accuracy.\n\n3. Model Selection: Experiment with different regression models such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, or gradient boosting regression. You can also consider using ensemble methods to combine multiple models for better accuracy.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This helps to assess the model's generalization capability and can guide hyperparameter tuning.\n\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model using grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. This process can significantly improve the model's performance.\n\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's robustness.\n\n7. Advanced Techniques: Consider using advanced techniques such as neural networks or deep learning models if the dataset is complex and contains non-linear relationships.\n\nImplementing these approaches can significantly enhance the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
