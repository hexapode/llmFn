      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider the following steps:\n\n1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale the features if using models like linear regression.\n\n2. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that might have a stronger correlation with the target variable. For example, you could create a \"total_bathrooms\" feature by adding the number of full bathrooms and half bathrooms.\n\n3. Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features to use in your prediction model. You could use techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance ranking, or dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the most significant features.\n\n4. Model Selection: Choose the appropriate prediction model based on the nature of the data and the problem. You could explore models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks, and compare their performance.\n\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model to achieve better performance. This can be done through techniques like grid search or randomized search.\n\n6. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and ensure that it generalizes well to new data.\n\nBy following these steps, you can improve the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
