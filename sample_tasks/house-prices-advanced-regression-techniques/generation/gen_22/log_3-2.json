Feature Engineering: Explore and create new features from the existing data that may have a stronger correlation with the house price.\n2. Handling Missing Data: Develop a strategy to handle missing data in a way that minimizes the impact on the prediction.\n3. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the data to prevent them from skewing the prediction.\n4. Normalization: Normalize the numerical features to ensure that they contribute equally to the prediction.\n5. Advanced Models: Implement more complex machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks, and optimize their hyperparameters.\n6. Cross-validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and minimize overfitting.\n7. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's generalization capabilities.\n8. Residual Analysis: Examine the residuals to identify any patterns that the model has failed to capture and adjust accordingly.\n\nBy incorporating these approaches, you can build a more robust and accurate prediction model for house prices."
