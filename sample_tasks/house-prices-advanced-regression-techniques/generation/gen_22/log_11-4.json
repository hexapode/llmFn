      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing features, for example, you can create a new feature that represents the total area of the house by combining LotArea, _1stFlrSF, and _2ndFlrSF.\n\n2. Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset which might be affecting the prediction accuracy.\n\n3. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques such as K-fold cross-validation to assess the model's predictive performance.\n\n4. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as Ridge or Lasso regression to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization.\n\n5. Feature Selection: Use techniques like Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, or Lasso regression to select the most important features for the prediction.\n\n6. Non-linear Models: Consider using non-linear regression models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to capture complex relationships in the data.\n\n7. Data Preprocessing: Standardize or normalize the numerical features, and encode categorical variables properly.\n\nBy considering these approaches, you can potentially improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Remember that the quality of the data and the complexity of the model play a crucial role in improving the prediction accuracy."
