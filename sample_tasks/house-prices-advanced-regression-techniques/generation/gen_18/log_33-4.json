      "content": "In order to improve the prediction accuracy of the house price, you can consider the following smart approaches:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that might have a stronger correlation with the house price, such as the ratio of the living area to the total lot area, or the age of the house at the time of sale.\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the data that might be impacting the accuracy of the predictions.\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which can improve model performance.\n4. Advanced Regression Techniques: Implement advanced regression techniques such as Ridge Regression, LASSO Regression, or Elastic Net Regression to handle multicollinearity and improve the model's predictive ability.\n5. Ensembling Methods: Implement ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to combine the predictions of multiple models for improved accuracy.\n6. Cross-Validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the model's robustness and improve generalization to new data.\n7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the hyperparameters of the model using techniques such as grid search or random search to find the optimal settings for improved performance.\n\nBy incorporating these approaches, you can enhance the accuracy of the house price prediction model."
