Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing features to capture more complex relationships in the data.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the data to prevent them from skewing the prediction.\n\n3. Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, while preserving important information.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.\n\n5. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.\n\n6. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to combine multiple models for better predictive performance.\n\n7. Hyperparameter Optimization: Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model.\n\nBy applying these smart approaches, you can enhance the prediction accuracy of the model."
