      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that might have a stronger correlation with the sales price.\n\n2. Outlier Removal: Identify and remove any outlier data points that might skew the prediction results.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the numerical input features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the prediction process.\n\n4. Advanced Algorithms: Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks to capture complex patterns in the data.\n\n5. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting.\n\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.\n\n7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance.\n\n8. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features using techniques like Lasso regression or recursive feature elimination.\n\nBy incorporating these smart ways, you can enhance the accuracy of the prediction model for house prices."
