      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following strategies:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features based on the existing ones, such as the total number of bathrooms, the ratio of living area to total area, or the age of the house at the time of sale. These engineered features can provide more insights for the model.\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that might affect the prediction. You can use statistical methods or domain knowledge to detect and address outliers.\n3. Normalization and Scaling: Scale the input features to have a similar range, which can help the model converge faster and improve prediction accuracy.\n4. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and fine-tune the hyperparameters to avoid overfitting and underfitting.\n5. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods such as random forest or gradient boosting to combine multiple models for better prediction accuracy.\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to the model's objective function.\n7. Addressing Missing Data: Handle missing data in the dataset by imputing values or using techniques such as mean/mode imputation or advanced imputation methods.\nImplementing these strategies can help improve the prediction accuracy for the house price model."
