      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing features to capture more information about the house.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that might be affecting the prediction accuracy.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Scale the numerical features to a similar range to prevent certain features from dominating the prediction.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, and fine-tune the model parameters accordingly.\n\n5. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to combine predictions from multiple models for better accuracy.\n\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization of the model.\n\n7. Incorporate External Data: If available, consider integrating external datasets that may contain relevant information about the houses or the neighborhood.\n\n8. Advanced Models: Experiment with more complex models such as neural networks or XGBoost to capture non-linear relationships in the data.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, you can enhance the prediction accuracy of the model and provide more accurate sales price estimations for the houses."
