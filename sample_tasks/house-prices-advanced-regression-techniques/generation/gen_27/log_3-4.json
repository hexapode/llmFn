      "content": "A smart way to improve the prediction accuracy would be to use machine learning algorithms, particularly regression models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. By training the model with historical housing data including the input characteristics and their corresponding sales prices, the model can learn to make more accurate predictions based on the input features.\n\nYou can split the data into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance, and also consider techniques such as feature engineering, data normalization, and cross-validation to further improve the accuracy of the predictions.\n\nPlease note that implementing machine learning algorithms would require more complex code and cannot be achieved solely within a simple JavaScript function. Thus, it would be more appropriate to use a machine learning framework or library such as TensorFlow.js or a Python-based library like scikit-learn to build and train the predictive model."
