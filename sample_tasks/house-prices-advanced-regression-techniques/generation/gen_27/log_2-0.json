      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart techniques:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new meaningful features from the existing ones that may have a stronger correlation with the sales price.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that may affect the prediction accuracy.\n\n3. Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and remove redundant information.\n\n4. Handling Missing Values: Use appropriate techniques to handle missing values in the dataset instead of just ignoring or filling them with default values.\n\n5. Regularization: Implement regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capability.\n\n6. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to assess the performance of the model and find the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen algorithm.\n\n7. Different Algorithms: Try using different regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, etc., and choose the one that best fits the data.\n\n8. Non-linear Relationships: Consider incorporating non-linear relationships between the input features and the sales price using techniques like polynomial regression or kernel methods.\n\nBy applying these techniques, you can improve the accuracy of the prediction model and produce more reliable estimates for the sales price of houses."
