These techniques can help identify complex patterns and interactions between the input features to make more accurate predictions. Additionally, you can consider feature engineering to create new informative features or transform existing ones to better capture the underlying relationships with the sales price. Regularization techniques can also be used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model."
