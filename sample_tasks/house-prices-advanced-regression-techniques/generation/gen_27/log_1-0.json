Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing features to provide additional information to the model.\n\n2. Selective Feature Importance: Identify the most important features that have the most influence on the sales price and focus on them.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the numeric features to have a similar scale to prevent certain features from having a larger impact on the prediction.\n\n4. Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that could affect the prediction accuracy.\n\n5. Regularization: Use techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to penalize large coefficients and prevent overfitting.\n\n6. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to combine the predictions of multiple models for better accuracy.\n\n7. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's generalizability and avoid overfitting.\n\nImplementing these methods may improve the accuracy of the house price prediction."
