You would need a dataset containing historical house sales data with features such as living area, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant characteristics, as well as the corresponding sales prices. By training the model on this dataset, you could potentially achieve a higher prediction accuracy compared to a simple rule-based approach.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that implementing a machine learning algorithm would require significantly more code and potentially a large amount of data processing and feature engineering. Additionally, it could increase the complexity of the solution."
