Specifically, we can train a machine learning model using historical house sales data with various input parameters such as neighborhood, overall quality, living area size, number of rooms, year built, etc. The model can then learn the patterns and relationships between the input parameters and the actual sales prices of houses. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the sales price of a new house based on its input characteristics.\n\nHere's how to implement it in the function:\n```javascript\n// Load the pre-trained machine learning model\nconst mlModel = require(\"./pretrained-model\");\n\nfunction predictHousePrice(Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2, BldgType, HouseStyle, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, RoofStyle, RoofMatl, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, ExterQual, ExterCond, Foundation, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinType2, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, Heating, HeatingQC, CentralAir, Electrical, _1stFlrSF, _2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenAbvGr, KitchenQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, Functional, Fireplaces, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageCars, GarageArea, GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, _3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, MiscVal, MoSold, YrSold, SaleType, SaleCondition) {\n  // Use the pre-trained machine learning model to predict the house price\n  const inputFeatures = {\n    MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, \n    // ...
