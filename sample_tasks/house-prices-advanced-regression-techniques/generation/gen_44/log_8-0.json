This model could use algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to learn the complex relationships between the input features and the sales price. Additionally, feature engineering could be used to create new meaningful features from the existing data to help the model make more accurate predictions. Moreover, conducting thorough data analysis and understanding the significance of different features in predicting house prices would further improve the accuracy of the predictions."
