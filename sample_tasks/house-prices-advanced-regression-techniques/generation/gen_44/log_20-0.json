      "content": "One novel way to predict the house price could be by using a machine learning model trained on a dataset of house characteristics and their corresponding sales prices. The model could use techniques like regression or neural networks to learn the relationships between the input features and the sales price.\n\nHowever, since we are restricted from using external libraries and services, we can create a simplified version of a machine learning model using a set of predefined rules and weights for each feature.\n\nFor example, we can assign weights to each input feature and then use these weights to calculate the predicted price based on the input characteristics. We can also incorporate some conditional logic to adjust the predicted price based on specific feature values.\n\nLet's implement this approach in the predictHousePrice function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictHousePrice(Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2, BldgType, HouseStyle, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, RoofStyle, RoofMatl, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, ExterQual, ExterCond, Foundation, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinType2, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, Heating, HeatingQC, CentralAir, Electrical, _1stFlrSF, _2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenAbvGr, KitchenQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, Functional, Fireplaces, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageCars, GarageArea, GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, _3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, MiscVal, MoSold, YrSold, SaleType, SaleCondition){\n    let predictedPrice = 180000;\n\n    // Define weights for each feature\n    const weights = {\n        OverallQual: 10000,\n        GarageType_Attchd: 15000,\n        GrLivArea_PerSqFt: 100,\n        YearsSinceBuilt: 500\n    };\n\n    // Use the weights to adjust the predicted price\n    predictedPrice += OverallQual * weights.OverallQual;\n    \n    if (GarageType === \"Attchd\") {\n        predictedPrice += weights.GarageType_Attchd;\n    }\n\n    predictedPrice += (GrLivArea - 1500) * weights.GrLivArea_PerSqFt;\n\n    let yearsSinceBuilt = YrSold - YearBuilt;\n    predictedPrice += yearsSinceBuilt * weights.YearsSinceBuilt;\n\n    return predictedPrice;\n}\n```"
