      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider the following smart ways:\n\n1. Use feature engineering to create new relevant features from the existing ones, such as creating a total square footage feature by adding the basement, first floor, and second floor square footage.\n\n2. Apply data normalization or standardization to make the input features more consistent and comparable.\n\n3. Implement more advanced machine learning models, such as random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks, to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.\n\n4. Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and tune the model hyperparameters effectively.\n\n5. Incorporate external datasets or information that could have an impact on the house prices, such as neighborhood crime rates, school district ratings, or proximity to public transportation.\n\n6. Perform thorough feature selection to identify the most influential features and remove irrelevant or redundant ones.\n\n7. Utilize ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models for a more robust and accurate prediction."
