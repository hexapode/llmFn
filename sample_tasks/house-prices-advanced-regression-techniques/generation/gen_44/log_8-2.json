      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to capture more information about the house. For example, you can create a feature that combines the total area of the basement, first floor, and second floor to represent the overall size of the house.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset. Outliers can significantly impact the predictive model's performance, so it's important to detect and deal with them appropriately.\n\n3. Cross-Validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This can help in understanding how well the model generalizes to new data and avoid overfitting.\n\n4. Regularization: Implement regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n5. Advanced Modeling Techniques: Consider using more advanced modeling techniques such as ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) or neural networks to capture the complex relationships within the dataset.\n\n6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters for improved performance.\n\nImplementing these strategies and fine-tuning the predictive model can help in improving the accuracy of the house price prediction."
