      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Feature Engineering: Identify and include important features that may have a strong impact on the house price. For example, you can create new features such as the age of the house when sold, the ratio of living area to lot area, and the total number of bathrooms in the house.\n\n2. Handling Missing Data: Implement a strategy to handle missing data for features with significant predictive power. You can consider imputing missing values based on the median or mean of the available data for that feature.\n\n3. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to ensure they do not unduly influence the predictions. You can consider using statistical methods or domain knowledge to identify outliers and handle them appropriately.\n\n4. Normalization and Scaling: Standardize numerical features to ensure that features with different scales have a fair impact on the prediction.\n\n5. Advanced Modeling Techniques: Utilize more advanced modeling techniques such as ensemble methods, gradient boosting, or neural networks to capture complex relationships between features and the house price.\n\nApplying these strategies can help improve the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
