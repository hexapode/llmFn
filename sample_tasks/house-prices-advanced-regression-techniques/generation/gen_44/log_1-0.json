      "content": "One smart way to improve the prediction accuracy is to use machine learning techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forest, or neural networks. By training a model on a large dataset of house characteristics and sales prices, the model can learn the complex relationships between the input features and the sales price, resulting in more accurate predictions.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering, which involves creating new features from the existing ones, can also improve prediction accuracy. This may include combining or transforming the existing features to capture more information that is relevant to the sales price.\n\nRegularization techniques such as Lasso or Ridge regression can be employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.\n\nFinally, it's important to thoroughly preprocess the data, handle missing values, and normalize or scale the features to ensure that the model performs well on the given input characteristics."
