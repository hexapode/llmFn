Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to capture more information or patterns in the data.\n2. Outlier Detection and Removal: Identify and remove outliers or anomalies in the data that may affect the prediction accuracy.\n3. Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between different features and the target variable to identify the most important features for prediction.\n4. Model Selection: Use more complex models such as ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and neural networks to capture non-linear relationships in the data.\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model to optimize its performance on the specific dataset.\n6. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to better estimate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.\n\nImplementing one or more of these strategies can help improve the prediction accuracy of the house price model."
