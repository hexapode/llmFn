      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy of the house price, you can consider the following smart approaches:\n\n1. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that have a higher impact on the house price and include them in the model. You can use techniques such as correlation analysis to determine the importance of each feature.\n\n2. Feature Engineering: Create new features that might have a stronger relationship with the house price. For example, you can combine the total area of the house by adding the basement area, ground living area, and the garage area.\n\n3. Regularization: Implement regularization techniques such as Lasso or Ridge regression to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.\n\n4. Non-linear relationships: Consider using non-linear models such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to capture complex relationships between the input features and the house price.\n\n5. Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data and to avoid overfitting.\n\n6. Outliers detection: Detect and handle outliers in the dataset to avoid skewed predictions.\n\nBy incorporating these smart approaches, you can enhance the prediction accuracy and create a more reliable model for predicting house prices."
