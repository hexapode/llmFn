Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data that might have a stronger correlation with the sales price.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers which might be skewing the model's predictions.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the input data to ensure all input features are on a similar scale.\n\n4. Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and choose the best-performing one.\n\n5. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model and reduce overfitting.\n\n6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to find the best combination for the given data.\n\n7. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capability.\n\n8. Handling Missing Data: Implement strategies to handle missing data in a way that preserves the quality of the prediction model.\n\nBy considering these methods, you can develop a more accurate prediction model for house prices."
