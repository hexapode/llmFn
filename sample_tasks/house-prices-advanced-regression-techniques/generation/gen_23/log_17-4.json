Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones, such as combining features, transforming variables, or creating interaction terms to capture more information.\n2. Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to prevent them from skewing the model's predictions.\n3. Advanced Modeling Techniques: Utilize advanced machine learning models such as ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) or neural networks to capture complex relationships in the data.\n4. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and select the best performing model.\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance on the given dataset.\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.\n7. Data Preprocessing: Standardize and normalize the input features, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables appropriately.\n8. Feature Selection: Identify the most important features and select a subset of features that contribute the most to the prediction task.\n9. Data Augmentation: If the dataset is limited, consider generating synthetic data to increase the diversity of the dataset.\n10. Evaluate Different Models: Experiment with different types of models to see which one performs best on the given dataset.\n\nBy implementing these smart ways, the prediction accuracy can be improved significantly."
