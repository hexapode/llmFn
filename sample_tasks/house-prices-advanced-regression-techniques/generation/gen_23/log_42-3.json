      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart approaches:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that might have a stronger correlation with the sales price. For example, you can combine the total square footage of the house or create interaction terms between some features.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset which might be affecting the prediction accuracy.\n\n3. Normalization and Scaling: Standardize the numerical features to bring them to a common scale, which can improve the performance of certain machine learning models.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data and prevent overfitting.\n\n5. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for predicting the sales price and exclude irrelevant or redundant features.\n\n6. Advanced Modeling Techniques: Implement more sophisticated machine learning models such as ensemble methods, gradient boosting, or neural networks to capture complex relationships in the data.\n\nBy incorporating these approaches, you can enhance the prediction accuracy of the model."
