Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that may have a stronger correlation with the sales price.\n\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that may be affecting the accuracy of the prediction.\n\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the numerical input features to bring them to a similar scale, which can help the model converge faster and improve accuracy.\n\n4. Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\n\n5. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.\n\n6. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Stacking to combine the predictions from multiple models for a more accurate result.\n\n7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using grid search or random search to find the best combination for improved accuracy.\n\nThese strategies can help improve the accuracy of the prediction and create a more reliable model for predicting house prices."
