      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart ways:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming the existing features to provide more relevant information to the model.\n2. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the data to avoid them affecting the prediction accuracy.\n3. Data Normalization: Normalize the numerical features to a similar scale to avoid dominance of certain features in the prediction.\n4. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.\n5. Regularization: Use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting the model to the training data.\n6. Different Models: Try different regression models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks to see if they provide better accuracy.\n7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize the model's performance.\n8. Feature Selection: Identify the most important features for the prediction using feature selection techniques to improve the model's accuracy.\n\nBy implementing these smart ways, you can potentially improve the prediction accuracy of the house price."
