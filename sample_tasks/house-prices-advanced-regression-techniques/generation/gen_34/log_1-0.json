      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart approaches:\n1. Feature Engineering: Create new features by combining or transforming existing features to capture more information.\n2. Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining important information.\n3. Handle Missing Data: Implement strategies such as imputation or use algorithms that can handle missing values effectively.\n4. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization of the model.\n5. Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to reduce bias and variance, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.\n6. Feature Selection: Use techniques to select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction.\n7. Cross-Validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the modelâ€™s performance and generalization ability.\n8. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.\n9. Use non-linear models: Consider using non-linear models such as neural networks or kernel-based methods to capture complex relationships in the data."
