Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\n"

      "content": "One smart way to improve the prediction accuracy could be to use machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to train a model on historical patient data with known outcomes. By using a machine learning model, the algorithm can learn intricate patterns and relationships between the input features and the outcomes, potentially leading to more accurate predictions.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering, which involves selecting and transforming the most relevant input features, can also improve the accuracy of the predictions. This may involve exploring interactions between different features, scaling or normalizing the input data, or creating new features based on domain knowledge.\n\nAnother approach could be to gather a larger and more diverse dataset to train the prediction model, which can help the model learn more generalizable patterns and improve its predictive power.\n\nLastly, conducting thorough feature selection to identify the most influential features and removing irrelevant or redundant ones can help refine the model and enhance prediction accuracy."
