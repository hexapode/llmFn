Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\n"

      "content": "One smart way to improve the prediction accuracy is to use machine learning algorithms to train a model on historical patient data. By using features such as N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, and Stage as input variables and the corresponding outcomes as the target variable, a machine learning model can learn the patterns in the data and make more accurate predictions.\n\nYou can try using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to build the prediction model. By training the model on a large and diverse dataset, the model can learn complex relationships between the input features and the outcomes, leading to improved prediction accuracy.\n\nIt's important to preprocess the data, handle missing values, normalize or scale the features, and use techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the model and prevent overfitting.\n\nUsing machine learning can help capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the input features, ultimately leading to better prediction accuracy compared to rule-based approaches."
