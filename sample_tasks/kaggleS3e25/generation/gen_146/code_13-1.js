    // You can improve the prediction accuracy by using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting. These algorithms can analyze the relationship between the input features and the outcome to make more accurate predictions.
    
    // Additionally, you can consider feature engineering to create new features that may have a more significant impact on the outcome. For example, you can create interaction terms between certain features, normalize the input data, or perform feature selection to focus on the most relevant features.
    
    // Furthermore, you can use cross-validation techniques to evaluate and optimize the performance of the prediction model. Cross-validation helps to assess how the model will generalize to new data and can prevent overfitting.
    
    // It's also important to collect a larger and more diverse dataset to train the prediction model, as a larger dataset can help the model learn more complex patterns and improve its accuracy.
    
    // Lastly, you can consider ensembling multiple models to combine their predictions and improve the overall accuracy. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, or stacking can be used to create a more robust prediction model.
