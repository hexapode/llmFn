Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\n"

      "content": "One way to potentially improve the prediction accuracy is to use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting. These algorithms can be trained on historical patient data to learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the outcomes. By using a large and diverse set of historical data, the algorithm can potentially make more accurate predictions for new patients.\n\nAnother approach could be feature engineering, where you analyze the input features to create new informative features that could better capture the relationship with the outcomes.\n\nIt's also important to ensure that the input features are properly pre-processed, normalized, and handled for missing values before training the model.\n\nAdditionally, using a larger and more diverse dataset for training the model could also improve prediction accuracy."
