Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\n"

Decision trees are capable of handling both numerical and categorical data, making them suitable for this type of prediction problem. Each node in the tree represents a decision point based on the input parameters, and the branches represent possible outcomes. The leaf nodes contain the predicted probabilities for each outcome.\n\nI will implement the decision tree algorithm in the function by creating a series of conditional statements based on the input parameters. Each condition will lead to a different outcome, and the probabilities will be assigned based on the paths taken through the tree.\n\nHere's the implementation of the decision tree algorithm for predicting cirrhosis outcomes:\n\n```javascript\nfunction PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage) {\n  var Status_C = 0.0; \n  var Status_CL = 0.0; \n  var Status_D = 0.0; \n  \n  if (Age < 5000) {\n    if (Bilirubin < 1.0 && Alk_Phos < 800 && SGOT < 120) {\n      Status_C = 0.9;\n    } else {\n      Status_CL = 0.7;\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (Ascites === \"N\") {\n      Status_C = 0.8;\n    } else {\n      if (Bilirubin > 2.0 && Stage >= 3.0) {\n        Status_D = 0.9;\n      } else {\n        Status_CL = 0.8;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    Status_C: Status_C,\n    Status_CL: Status_CL,\n    Status_D: Status_D\n  };\n}\n```"
