Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\n"

      "content": "To improve the prediction accuracy, you could consider using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks. These techniques can handle complex relationships between input features and output labels, and can provide better predictions by learning from the data.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering and feature selection can also play a crucial role in improving prediction accuracy. You can explore different combinations of input features, derive new features from the existing ones, and select the most relevant features for the prediction task.\n\nFurthermore, tuning the model hyperparameters, cross-validation, and ensembling different models can also contribute to improving the prediction accuracy.\n\nLastly, collecting more diverse and representative data, as well as understanding the domain knowledge, can provide valuable insights for feature selection and model building, ultimately improving the prediction accuracy."
