Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\n"

      "content": "For improving the prediction accuracy, you can consider using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, or gradient boosting. These techniques allow the model to learn from the input data and discover complex patterns that can improve the accuracy of the predictions.\n\nHere are some potential steps to improve prediction accuracy:\n1. Feature Engineering: Analyze the input variables and create new features that could have strong predictive power.\n2. Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning models to find the one that provides the best accuracy for the given dataset.\n3. Cross-validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model and tune the hyperparameters to avoid overfitting and underfitting.\n4. Ensemble Methods: Combine the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall accuracy.\n5. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features and remove irrelevant or redundant features to simplify the model and enhance its predictive power.\n\nBy utilizing these techniques, you can build a more sophisticated and accurate prediction model for the Cirrhosis Outcomes."
