Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., C, CL, and D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: C, CL,D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\n"

The function should return the hashmap with the probabilities, but when it is converted to a string, it shows as \"[object Object]\". \nYou can access the values of the hashmap using the keys. For example, to access the probability for \"CL\", you can use the following code:\n\n```javascript\nvar outcomes = PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(732, 'D-penicillamine', 13073, 'F', 'N', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 6.1, 1712.0, 2.83, 89.0, 3681.0, 158.1, 139.0, 303.0, 10.0, 2.0);\nvar probabilityCL = outcomes.CL;\nconsole.log(probabilityCL); // This will output the probability for outcome \"CL\"\n```\n\nYou can now use the function along with the patient's information and access the probabilities for each outcome using the keys \"C\", \"CL\", and \"D\"."
