Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\n"

      "content": "To improve prediction accuracy, you can consider the following smart approaches:\n\n1.  Feature engineering: Examine the input features and derive new features that may have a stronger correlation with the outcomes. For example, creating interaction terms or polynomial features can capture non-linear relationships.\n\n2.  Data normalization: Normalize the input data to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the prediction. This can involve scaling the features to a standard range or using techniques like log transformation.\n\n3.  Ensemble learning: Use ensemble techniques such as random forests or gradient boosting to combine predictions from multiple models. This can often lead to improved performance compared to a single model.\n\n4.  Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation to assess the model's performance with different subsets of the data. This can provide a more reliable estimate of the model's predictive ability.\n\n5.  Regularization: Introduce regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capability.\n\n6.  Hyperparameter tuning: Identify the best hyperparameters for the chosen model using techniques like grid search or randomized search. This can significantly enhance the model's performance.\n\nBy applying these techniques, you can enhance the accuracy of the prediction model and ensure that it provides more reliable outcomes."
