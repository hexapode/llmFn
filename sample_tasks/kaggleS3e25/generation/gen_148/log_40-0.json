Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\n"

      "content": "One smart way to improve the prediction accuracy would be to implement a machine learning model using a larger dataset of patient information and outcomes. By training a model on a diverse and comprehensive dataset, the model can learn complex patterns and relationships between the input features and the outcome classes, thus improving the accuracy of predictions.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering and selecting the most relevant features for the prediction task can also improve accuracy. Applying techniques such as feature scaling, normalization, and dimensionality reduction can help the model to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nFurthermore, using more advanced machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks could also lead to improved prediction accuracy compared to using simple probability-based approaches.\n\nIt's also important to consider the balance between different classes in the dataset when building the model, as imbalanced classes can lead to biased predictions. Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights can address this issue and improve the model's ability to predict minority classes accurately."
