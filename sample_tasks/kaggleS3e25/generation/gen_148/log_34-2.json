Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\n"

      "content": "One way to improve the prediction accuracy is to consider using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting. These algorithms can be trained on a dataset with historical patient information and outcomes to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the cirrhosis outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering can play a crucial role in improving prediction accuracy. This involves creating new features or transforming existing features to enhance the predictive power of the model. For example, creating interaction terms between certain features, normalizing or scaling the input features, or adding polynomial features can all contribute to better predictive performance.\n\nFurthermore, optimizing the model hyperparameters through techniques such as grid search or randomized search can also lead to improved accuracy. Fine-tuning the model's parameters can help in finding the best combination for the given dataset, leading to better predictions.\n\nLastly, using ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting can also be beneficial. These methods combine multiple models to improve predictive performance by reducing overfitting and increasing the overall accuracy of the predictions.\n\nIt's important to note that these approaches require a good understanding of machine learning techniques and may involve more complex implementation compared to a simple function."
