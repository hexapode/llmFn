Each id in the test set had a single true class label, Status. For each id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g., Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D.\nTo solve this task you need to create a javascript function that take into parameters A set of information about a patient and return An hashmap with 3 keys: Status_C, Status_CL and Status_D. Each key has a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the patient to have the corresponding outcome..\nOutput the code between ```javascript and ``` tags.\nDo not add usage sample code, only output the functions.\nTry to compute the probability to the best of your ability based on the parameters inputs! DO NOT Output Placeholder CODE! Actually implement the function!\nYour are not allow to use any external library or call any external service/library/function.\nYour output function should NOT contain ANY Comment. Do not add inline comments in the code. Do the calculations in the function, do not put a comment saying what to do instead.\nThe function should be named PredictCirrhosisOutcomes  and its signature should be PredictCirrhosisOutcomes(N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage).\nThe function should be deterministic, it should always return the same output for a given input.\nThe function should contain calculations, not just a lookup table.\n"

      "content": "One potential way to improve the prediction accuracy is to use a machine learning model, such as a logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest, to train on a dataset with labeled outcomes. The model can learn the complex relationships between the input features (N_Days, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage) and the corresponding outcomes. This approach may capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the input variables, leading to improved prediction accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, feature engineering may be helpful in identifying and creating new relevant features from the existing dataset. Feature selection techniques can help to identify the most important features for the prediction, while feature scaling can ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.\n\nFurthermore, cross-validation can be used to evaluate the model's performance and to ensure that it generalizes well to new data. Regularization techniques can also be applied to prevent overfitting and improve the model's robustness.\n\nLastly, gathering a larger and more diverse dataset that represents a wider range of patient characteristics and outcomes can also improve the prediction accuracy of the model."
